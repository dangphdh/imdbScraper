            "reviewBody": "Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.\n\nThis is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won&apos;t be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I&apos;m sure it could be number 1. So I&apos;ll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.\n\nKing is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. \n\nWhat makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don&apos;t know if there will again.\n\nI&apos;m not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",

Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer&quot;\n\n&quot;The Godfather Part II is truly a masterpiece. Timeless, Classic, Beautiful and endlessly watchable&quot;\n\nThe second part of Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s Epic and violent Gangster Trilogy, follows the reign of Don Michael Corleone as the head of the Corleone family. As well the film shows us the early years of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) played flawlessly by Academy Award Winner Robert De Niro, and how he created his empire of money, gambling and respect. Beautifully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Godfather Part II exceeds every expectation with outstanding performances from Academy Award winners Al Pacino,Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro. The second part of this unforgettable trilogy is one of the finest films ever made. \n\nThis is cinematic art. A treasure of film history. The finest sequel ever made. A faultless, flawless gripping drama; Coppola&apos;s second part of his crime saga is in my opinion one of the top 5 films of all time and perhaps towering over the first part. \n\n&quot;As close to perfection as movies get&quot;\n\n&quot;Pacino at his best&quot;\n\n-10/10-",

            "reviewBody": "This once-in-a-generation masterpiece simply has no equal. The late 90&apos;s TV remake was quite adequate though totally unnecessary and in the upshot proved simply that updating a film for updating&apos;s sake is really an exercise in futility. Even had it BEEN as good - so what?\n\nThere could be few, if ANY film-goers reading this who are unaware of the plotline and in any event many others have re-hashed this for you. The brilliance of the film is evident in so many aspects. To begin with, the ability to not only sustain interest but to command the viewer&apos;s attention for basically its entire running time within a setting of principally just one room, borders on the inspired. Whether or not that would actually work with TODAY&apos;S audiences is another discussion! What we have here are twelve everyday Mr Joe Blows, summoned together on a jury panel to decide a defendant&apos;s guilt or innocence with regards to a murder charge. If you were to gather unto yourselves ANY twelve jurors at random, you would most likely be able to pinpoint the Henry Fonda, Lee Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden etc etc amongst them! Their very &quot;ordinariness&quot; is where the film succeeded. Everyone can identify with at least ONE of those characters. Whether or not he may WANT to is a different matter. The thinker, the sensitive man, the arrogant bully, the opportunist, the mentally challenged loudmouth, the slimeball, the emotionally withdrawn, the sheep etc - they&apos;re all here! Welcome to society folks! I dislike society in the main - doubtless a reason I found this film to be such a revelation..even when I was barely into my teens!\n\n12 ANGRY MEN also pinpoints the shortcomings of the law, how &quot;truth&quot; can be so intrinsically left-field and unintentionally flawed. Lumet, working within a minimal budget here, delivers unstinting brilliance in both direction, character portrayal and script interpretation. He had of course superb acting talent at his disposal although some of the most memorable performances are from the lesser players. Some have denounced Fonda&apos;s role as being acceptable rather than awesome. I think however he was to a great degree playing himself here, not to an audience. His, is a study in deliberation and logic not show-pony stuff, but hell that never WAS Fonda was it?\n\nThis is a great great movie, as is evidenced by the extremely high user-vote worldwide. IF you haven&apos;t seen it - you really should do something about that!",

            "reviewBody": "All the threads of Tolkien&apos;s magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson&apos;s adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.\n\n&quot;Return of the King&quot; is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.\n\nThe cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien&apos;s creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.\n\nNow that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien&apos;s huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien&apos;s source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien&apos;s myth than anyone had the right to hope for.\n\nA masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some...",

            "reviewBody": "One of the early scenes in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it&apos;s also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn&apos;t know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; wouldn&apos;t be &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.\n\nIt&apos;s no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won&apos;t pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or &quot;art about art.&quot; It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I&apos;ve ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.\n\nThe movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it&apos;s essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino&apos;s originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.\n\nPerhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, &quot;Be cool and no one&apos;s going to get hurt,&quot; which is just the type of line you&apos;d find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren&apos;t just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia&apos;s statement to Vincent, &quot;That&apos;s when you know you&apos;ve found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.&quot;\n\nWhat is the movie&apos;s purpose exactly? I&apos;m not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn&apos;t just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it&apos;s a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.\n\nThere&apos;s a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch&apos;s act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we&apos;re never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.\n\nStill, it&apos;s hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really &quot;about&quot; anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn&apos;t need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.",

Real Westerns. This is the best of the Dollars Trilogy and by far one of the best Westerns of all time. It has drama, comedy, cracking dialogue, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around the bridge - that I&apos;d seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that just ooze atmosphere and tension. I have never forgotten the end shoot-out. This was unique; 3 people?! You can&apos;t do that. But Leone did, and he did it brilliantly - all cameras and music. I have now seen this film too many times to count but I&apos;ll be back for another blast of buono, brutto, cattivo, someday. My son owes his name to this film. Yep, that there is Clinton.",

Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn&apos;t as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don&apos;t like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there&apos;s no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn&apos;t seen it or who thinks that don&apos;t like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...",

            "reviewBody": "&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis&apos; motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character&apos;s natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them, but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living, moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill&apos;s army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto). As all this occurs, Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot; fame). In the end not one, but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise&apos;s final installment (&quot;The Return of the King&quot;). Many view &quot;The Two Towers&quot; as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout, while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship, love and personal sacrifice. In short, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5.",

            "reviewBody": "The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action.  It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development.  The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film.  The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series.  This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn&apos;t mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional.  This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish.",

I&apos;ve seen many movies, but there aren&apos;t much movies which had such an impact on me. Nowadays almost all filmmakers believe they can only make a good movie by adding loads of special effects and lots of huge explosions ... This movie is so good, so convincing without them. The actors played their roles in such a convincing way that you would think these weren&apos;t actors at all, but real psychiatric patients.\n\nThis movie may be 30 years old, but it hasn&apos;t lost any of its relevancy. OK, we don&apos;t put our mentally ill people in that kind of prisons anymore, the bars in front of the windows have gone and now we call it hospitals in stead of nut houses. But the treatment hasn&apos;t changed all that much. I once worked in such a hospital as a volunteer and still saw things like forced feeding, giving people so much medication until they no longer know who or where they are,...\n\nWhen the movie first came out, some people were shocked because when you watch the movie, you can&apos;t help it feeling more attached to the patients than to the doctors and nurses. This movie shows that cinema can make a difference. It can help to open people&apos;s eyes. If there is a movie that should be seen by everyone, this sure is the one. I give it a well deserved 10/10.",

            "reviewBody": "The movie, &quot;Se7en&quot;, starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.\n\nThe story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri&apos;s seven deadly sins from &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, sets out to, &quot;preach&quot; about man&apos;s impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film&apos;s conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en&apos;s surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en&apos;s poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.\n\nDirected brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90&apos;s. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.\n\nScore 10/10",

            "reviewBody": "Though its biblical connotation is not the happiest one (&quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot;) number seven, omnipresent in our (7 days a) weekly cycles, seems to have been a lucky number in the world of cinema. Several very solid and some great movies have this number in their title, starting with gag-wise incredibly inventive Seven Chances (1925) from genius of silent era Buster Keaton, Frank Borzage&apos;s silent version of classic melodrama 7th Heaven (1927), Walt Disney&apos;s first feature-length animated movie, Snowhite and Seven Dwarfs (1940), recognized as an instant classic and remained so ever after, Stanley Donen&apos;s ear-pleasing, eye-riveting musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), staged in western milieu, with the breathtaking barn-raising dance sequence, Ingmar Bergman&apos;s literally Death-defying, answers-to-reasons-for-human-misfortune-seeking masterpiece, Det sjunde inseglet (&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;) (1957), Billy Wilder&apos;s Seven Year Itch (1957), a clever and amusing first collaboration with incomparable Marilyn Monroe (a worm-up for their second, bigger if not decisive step in taboos-of-the-motion-picture-production-code-breaking, brilliant comedy Some Like It Hot (1959)), up to newer examples like David Fincher&apos;s disturbing drama Se7en (1995), one of the finest Hollywood movies of the 90&apos;s, as well as Tsui Hark&apos;s Chat Gim (&quot;Seven Swords&quot;) (2005), a stunner in the department of action sequences from the often under-appreciated genre Wuxia, originating from Chinese literature.\n\nHowever, even among such illustrious examples of movie-making par excellence, one movie holds a special place, Shichinin no samurai (&quot;Seven Samurai&quot;) (1954) from the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. This movie doesn&apos;t seem to lack anything that an avid movie consumer, in particular samurai genre admirer, might be wishing for.\n\nIt is not easy to say anything new about the one of the most analyzed and scrutinized movies of the film history. Nevertheless, and despite being eventually only repeated, it shall be mentioned that movie has a simple but very engaging story - a group of peasants, representing a village, periodically stormed by gang of bandits, looting their crops and other possessions, hires several wandering ronins (masterless samurai) to help them protect the village - not without lucid observations on the possibility of social interaction between members of different classes during the almost seven centuries long feudal history (1185-1868) of Japan.\n\nCharacterization is excellent, and though having clear stand-outs in samurai&apos;s true leader, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), a wise tactician of the exceptional valor, as well as in the exuberantly uncontrollable Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune), messy in its appearance and blustering in its manner, yet, a peasant descendant himself, making for a perfect link between the samurai and their employers, all other samurai are memorable, as well, sporting wide variety of personality traits. In joining the village protection campaign, hired for nothing more than a regular meal for as long as providing a service, thus primarily hoping to finally fill their starving stomachs, each one of them was driven by different additional motives, whether they were challenged to test their bravery, fighting skills and tactics, seeking for excitement and recognition, trying to regain pride and glory of the past days, just reaching out for that human touch (cross-class communication, even mere courtship promising relationship) they have been deprived of, or simply interested in its noble cause.\n\nTogether with true highlights in realistically choreographed battle scenes, showing all the pain and misery of excessive violence on the reverse of heroism, that even defenders cannot avoid resorting to, sadly announcing inevitable decline of the samurai and their ways exposed to new artless technology, unbecomingly dying ambushed by distant shots from the muskets, while ingloriously stuck in the village muds... it all makes for a compelling narrative.\n\nThough triumphant in their common task to protect the village, unlikely alliance between samurai and peasants is ultimately doomed to fail. In the short run, it gives expected results, but in the long run, does not stand the chance. That is so loudly, although in fact silently, expressed at the end, when peasants don&apos;t even care to join the surviving samurai in their mourning over the fallen ones, not even giving the last well deserved respect to those who have helped them withstand fierce attacks, prevail and ultimately defeat bandits, and, in doing so, most of them given their lives. Peasants simply continue with their daily chores, while surviving samurai have to leave the village, like they have never existed, sadly symbolizing their ultimate destiny: slowly but surely stepping off the future pages of the history books.\n\nSeven Samurai, the movie, is rightfully considered as the one that has redefined samurai film in its contemporary perception, and dawned almost two decades long string of successes, instantly becoming the brightest example of thus revived, uniquely provocative and entertaining sub-genre, unknown as such in the country of its origin, classified there within a broader genre, jidaigeki (a period drama, often describing events from pre-modern era of the Edo period, marking the governance of Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868), relatively peaceful times for Japan&apos;s long history of civil wars, as opposed to gendaigeki, films treating contemporary matters), and by IMDb standards, as an action drama, occasionally historical, when based on real events.\n\nOriginating in the Edo-era Far East, it has inspired equally successful, star-studded (Y. Brynner, S. McQueen, C. Bronson, J. Coburn, E. Wallach, R. Vaughn, H. Buchholz, B. Dexter) Hollywood remake, The Magnificent Seven (1960), conveniently situated in the U.S. West of 19th century, as well as three lesser sequels, Return of... (1966), Guns of... (1969), and ...Ride! (1972).",

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always thought that the reason It&apos;s A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.\n\nGeorge Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He&apos;s got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he&apos;s got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the &quot;richest and meanest man in town&quot;, embodied in Lionel Barrymore.\n\nIt&apos;s a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn&apos;t hurt him.\n\nRemember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.\n\nBut before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he&apos;s given the story of George Bailey&apos;s life. And we see the kind of struggles he&apos;s had, the sacrifices he&apos;s made for the good of a whole lot of others. We&apos;ve also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. \n\nSomething happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It&apos;s driven him to the brink of despair. That&apos;s why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It&apos;s something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.\n\nBut I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven&apos;t contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It&apos;s a simple, but profound lesson.\n\nWhat if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It&apos;s an interesting point of speculation.\n\nIn addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.\n\nDonna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.\n\nWhen Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he&apos;s saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. \n\nAnd that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It&apos;s A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.",

It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The two lead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.  A quality film in all aspects!",

            "reviewBody": "The film revolves around the, &apos;City of God,&apos; a favela (or ghetto) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area where drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence. \n\nThe story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960&apos;s) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket&apos;s dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.\n\nThe film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60&apos;s, 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children. \n\nThe direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.\n\nThe film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all. \n\n10/10, A+\n\nWould also recommend: Bus 174 and Carandiru",

It is a soul numbing realistic depiction of what our grandfathers, fathers, uncles, brothers and sons have faced in humanities darkest moments. Not just in WWII but in any war. No one can see this movies without being altered in some way. No one should miss it with the EXCEPTION of those war veterans that have already been there. The surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle. \n\nSteven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every time the question of war comes up. This movie would not stop future wars but I would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined. I say this as a US Marine.",

But the way he protects his kid from the horrors of the genocide, how he always tries to find ways to make his wife and kid smile and laugh, is what makes the movie, a MUST SEE.\n\nIt is certainly one of the best movies that I have seen.",

There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.\n\nThis was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a &quot;Hathaway hater&quot; like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in &quot;Wild&quot;.\n\nThis may be the greatest ever film about physics.",

It will seem slow to the impatient, but will be richly rewarding for those with the stamina to make it to the end. \n\nIt will certainly get you thinking about capital punishment and perhaps different shades/degrees of evil. It is either a deeply moving spiritual tale or a wonderfully creepy journey down the rabbit hole of Stephen King&apos;s mind; take your pick. Either way, I put it right up there on my desert island list with the likes of Shawshank Redemption. It is definitely required watching.",

What would happen if you went back in time and an innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? It&apos;s something to think about.\n\nI won&apos;t reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for those who haven&apos;t seen it. Let&apos;s just say that Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated by Marty threaten his very existence. He is aided by Doc Brown played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time.\n\nThe movie is great-and I feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres. In fact, I find it hard to believe anyone could dislike a film like this. It has action, adventure, plenty of humour and some cool moments. All the actors involved in the movie play their parts great.\n\nAnyone who watches this movie will love it.",

            "reviewBody": "&apos;Spirited Away&apos; is the first Miyazaki I have seen, but from this stupendous film I can tell he is a master storyteller. A hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character. Miyazaki does this brilliantly in &apos;Spirited Away&apos;. During the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on. Neither does the main character Chihiro. We discover the world as Chihiro does and it&apos;s truly amazing to watch. But Miyazaki doesn&apos;t seem to treat this world as something amazing. The world is filmed just like our workaday world would. The inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks. Places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music. The fact that this place is amazing doesn&apos;t seem to concern Miyazaki. \n\nWhat do however, are the characters. Miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors. He infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that I have never seen, even from animation giants Pixar. Twenty minutes into this film and I completely forgot these were animated characters; I started to care for them like they were living and breathing. Miyazaki treats the modest achievements of Chihiro with unashamed bombast. The uplifting scene where she cleanses the River God is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight. Of course, by giving the audience developed characters to care about, the action and conflicts will always be more exciting, terrifying and uplifting than normal, generic action scenes. \n\nThrough Chihiro, Miyazaki is clearly (but non-patronisingly) talking to youth of Japan. There&apos;s a certain sense of revile about the youth of Japan at the moment. Many people consider them to be ill-mannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers. They are simply bi-products of their material world and consumerism. &apos;Spirited Away&apos; taps into this. At the start Chihiro is a selfish, spoiled, whiny brat. But as she plunges deeper into the spirit world, she becomes more independent, more assured, more respectful and learns some manners. No Face, a black figure with a white mask, is the catalyst behind Chihiro&apos;s transformation. Once he is let into the bathhouse, we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth. Watching No Face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight. The three main characters in Miyazaki&apos;s youth allegory are Chihiro, No Face and Bô. All of these characters are disconnected with their world. They are lonely, misunderstood and largely ignored. But when they go on their journey together, they united and become stronger individuals.\n\nMiyazaki also talks about the ecology of Japan. What was once a beautiful; grassland has now turned into the Asian New York. That The Last Samurai had to be filmed in New Zealand to get a turn of the century Japanese look speaks volumes. The River God sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution. While these two themes are very much current in Japan, they are also universal themes  which makes &apos;Spirited Away&apos; a universal story that most of us can connect with. I&apos;m willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully. Sure these themes aren&apos;t advanced philosophy. They are everyday issues told in an inventive, fun way.\n\nThe animation is wonderful, if not as smooth as Disney&apos;s works  but there&apos;s something superior to that. &apos;Spirited Away&apos;s imperfect, but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of Disney&apos;s latest offerings. The animators successfully balanced the tight-rope between not-enough animation on characters and too much animation on characters. No Ralph Balski ADD antics here! The film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying. The line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly. From Chihiro and Haku running through an opening flower field to Haku&apos;s dragon snarling with a bloody mouth, both extremes seem to belong in the film. It&apos;s also excellently done with the characters. Kamaji can be seen as a scary, daunting figure at the beginning, but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble, wise figure. Yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger. \n\nThe sound on the film was expertly done. The sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects. My sub woofer got a wonderful workout when Haku swoops Chihiro past the bridge at the beginning. And while I don&apos;t speak Japanese, I think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice. Joe Hisaishi&apos;s music is sublime, definitely one of my favourite scores. His main piano theme is simple and evocative. His thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer. Like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times. The score, unlike many American composers&apos;, is unobtrusive. It plays excellently with the scenes, but never overbears them. A lot of the time the it is barely noticeable, a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlike/lullaby quality. \n\n&apos;Spirited Away&apos; is a simply a modern masterpiece, easily one of the Top 10 films of the new millennium. It works on a multitude of levels; a social commentary on Japan, a homage to ancient Japanese/Russian mythology, a moral film for both children and adults. But most importantly, it is a simple story brilliantly told by a great filmmaker who appears to be at the top of his game. &apos;Spirited Away&apos; works much like a relaxing journey. Pop in the DVD; leave this world for two hours and when you will be almost certainly enriched and ready to take the trip again.",

            "reviewBody": "What can you say about a film that&apos;s been talked about to death? Just this: If you&apos;ve never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it&apos;s a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it&apos;s so fun to watch.\n\nJanet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss&apos;s obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk&apos;s possessive mother, who as her boy explains, &quot;is not herself today.&quot; I&apos;ll say she isn&apos;t, and so would Leigh&apos;s Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that &quot;Do-Not-Disturb&quot; sign before taking a shower.\n\nYou can feel the decade literally shifting out of &apos;50s and into &apos;60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what&apos;s going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.\n\nMost especially, there&apos;s Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion&apos;s boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word &quot;falsity&quot; or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.\n\nHe shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam&apos;s boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you&apos;re always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he&apos;s busy covering up &quot;Mother&apos;s&quot; misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.\n\nIf you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote&apos;s. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for &quot;Psycho.&quot; Certainly &quot;Psycho&quot; looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.\n\nIt&apos;s thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.\n\nIs it the best Hitchcock movie? It&apos;s definitely one of his best, right up there with &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; and &quot;Strangers On A Train&quot; and &quot;Sabotage&quot; and &quot;Shadow Of A Doubt.&quot; He only once again came close to making as good a film, with &quot;The Birds,&quot; while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.\n\nOften imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, &quot;Psycho&quot; still isn&apos;t played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready.",

            "reviewBody": "Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.\n\nEvery single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.\n\nOverall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.\n\nPawel Edelman&apos;s camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.\n\nHervé de Luze&apos;s editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.\n\nThe scene where Brody&apos;s fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.\n\nGreat film that will be in the running for this year&apos;s Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10.",

We need to shed our cultural biases, including &quot;how&quot; to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future.",

Leon is amazingly n very differently portrayed by Reno.\n\nThere is a Bollywood copy known as Bichoo (Scorpio).\n\nThe only thing good in the Bollywood movie is that the guy who played Tony gives away all of the hitman&apos;s money to the girl whereas in the original, the character of Tony gives only a single currency note to Mathilda n keeps blabbing the same &quot;safer than the usual bank story&quot;.",

There&apos;s no characters standing around screaming about &quot;Those goddamn Mexicans, I don&apos;t want THEM changing my locks so THEY can rob the place with their little essays!&quot;, right in front of them. \n\nThe acting is great all around, and Edward Norton gives one of the best performances of all time. I can&apos;t believe he didn&apos;t win best actor. While I haven&apos;t seen Benji&apos;s performance, I doubt he was half as good as Norton. The film is also highly inspirational and moving. \n\nHow is it that this wasn&apos;t even nominated for best picture, while Crash was AND won? Crazy.\n\nThis should be shown in schools.",

I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.\n\nI&apos;m a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn&apos;t even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese&apos;s, respective visions.\n\nAll the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese&apos;s long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again.",

However, since it is not, Singer and MacQuarrie (who have joined forces again after the not-so-successful PUBLIC ACCESS) took advantage and duplicated nothing but the best. From CASABLANCA to PULP FICTION, and even a version of a line (intentionally or otherwise) from BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.\n\nMany people oppose watching a film with a twist a second time. I disagree. By watching it again you can observe how the director and the screenwriter have hidden and revealed clues, how they have tried to steer the audience away from the ending. First time is for entertainment. Second time is for art. This film is certainly worthwhile to see again. To date, I have watched it five times. (Two of those five times I thought, &apos;well, I&apos;ll just watch about half-an-hour,&apos; but ended up watching the entire film because it is so entertaining.) I&apos;m not exactly a noir fan, so it is assured that this particular crime film appeals to a wider audience.\n\nTHE USUAL SUSPECTS has a skilled director, an engrossing screenplay, and ten praiseworthy performances. The film runs a fast 105 minutes. Don&apos;t miss a minute of it.",

            "reviewBody": "Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.\n\nThe final pay-off of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in &apos;The Prestige&apos;s arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. &apos;The turn&apos; comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.\n\nThe prestige as the end note to the show  in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of &apos;The Prestige&apos; of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a &quot;gotcha&quot;-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.\n\nOur two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale&apos;s technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the &apos;Abracadabra&apos; entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan&apos;s.\n\nTo further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point)  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine&apos;s character puts forward.\n\nWith Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. &apos;Antihero&apos; gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate &apos;prestige&apos; of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public&apos;s recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.\n\n&apos;The Prestige&apos; is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan&apos;s next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).\n\n9 out of 10",

They teach you there&apos;s a boundary line to music. But, man, there&apos;s no boundary line to art.&quot; \n\nCharlie Parker sums it all, Cinema is true Art. I wasn&apos;t expecting to feel this way after watching this movie. Every moment has tension and something unexpected occurring. It is as if the director had chosen to apply the tempo of the drums to the script. Anyone can relate to this story. We all have pursued a dream, a passion ... Rather or not we made it our everyday job or maybe just a hobby aside, some of us strive for something bigger. \n\nThis film is a journey in the search of your inner spirit, inner creativity ... not only will it make it clear that you cannot succeed without effort and hard work, it will also make you realize there are two different kinds of artists : - those who make art, - and those who make beautiful art\n\n&quot;Beautiful&quot; because they are stimulated by a special strength within, a GIFT. \n\nIs it because I reminisce N.Y.C. or that I play the drums? I simply believe the performances were astonishing and the actors perfectly chosen to embody these terrific characters. I won&apos;t say &quot;good job&quot; but rather &quot;thank you&quot;, to the promising Franco-American director Damien Chazelle﻿ for sharing his vision.",

Rather than some &quot;off the cuff&quot; comments, I&apos;ll quote instead from my article on Claude Rains (from March 2000 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES) that pretty well sums up the film:\n\n&quot;It was 1943&apos;s &apos;Casablanca&apos;, bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue, that really put him (Claude Rains) in the forefront as one of the screen&apos;s smoothest character actors, almost--but not quite--stealing the film from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as the uniformed Captain Louis Renault who investigates the goings-on at Rick&apos;s notorious cafe.\n\n Nobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screen classic, least of all its director, Michael Curtiz, the prolific WB director to whom it was just another assignment.  It went on to win the Oscar for Best Film of 1943 with an award for Curtiz&apos; taut direction.\n\nOddly enough, the film&apos;s memorable airport ending was written and conceived just shortly before filming wrapped up, with neither Bergman nor Bogart knowing whether or not she would leave him for husband Paul Henried. Wartime audiences loved the film. Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt, Victor Francen and Peter Lorre all gave sterling performances and Rains was again nominated for Best Supporting actor.&quot;\n\nAnd by the way, I disagree with a former comment indicating the black and white photography of this film was primitive as compared to today&apos;s. Incredible nonsense!!  As a matter of fact, the film&apos;s black and white cinematography was nominated for an Oscar!\n\nIngrid Bergman was at the peak of her radiant beauty in this one--and Bogey was firing on all six cylinders. Great chemistry! \n\nAs time goes by, we still have &apos;Casablanca&apos;...",

In a series of flashbacks, we learn who he is, why he came, and what has occurred since. Although quietly told by another ex-warrior (about whom we also learn more), this is an interesting story that builds in complexity and tension. Debates about rituals and appearances may at first seem to hold more significance in old Japan than in the contemporary United States, but it is not difficult to translate and implement such thoughts. Love, honor, duty, family, children, saving &quot;face&quot;, determination, desperationthey all exist in OUR everyday lives. Dramatically photographed in beautiful black &amp; white, given a strong Japanese score, and paced so that even the mildly patient will be glad they saw it, &quot;Harakiri&quot; is epically huge, and a must-see for story &amp; film lovers.",

            "reviewBody": "This film proves without any doubt that animation isn&apos;t just suited to tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy and violence. This absolutely heartbreaking Japanese anime tells the story of a young boy, Seito and his younger sister, Setsuko, as they attempt to survive the American bombings on Japan in the last year of World War II.\n\nThe story itself, based on a true story, is powerful enough but the decision to animate the film truly elevates this film to a higher level. This would have been a powerful enough live action drama, along the lines of Spielberg&apos;s Empire of the Sun or even Schindler&apos;s List. However, the Studio Ghibli team, have brought an extraordinary amount of life to all the characters, but especially the young siblings. Now we&apos;re not talking realism as such here - the characters are in no way photo-realistic, they do have the usual characteristics of Japanese anime humans, large eyes and exaggerated expressions. What this achieves however is a heightened level of subtle nuances in expression which are arguably more powerful and provocative than anything a real-life actor may achieve. Some may claim this is overly manipulative or sentimental, but coupled with the characters movements and actions, it gives the characters such a strong, and very human, presence. You truly care for these kids, which is an astonishing achievement. The voice cast (original Japanese) contributes significantly here also.\n\nIt is the tiny moments which give this film so much power and emotional depth - from subtle expressions to brief scenes showing Seito playing with his sister at bath time, attempting, unsuccessfully, to cheer her up when she misses her mother. The painted backgrounds are works of art in themselves, just beautiful. And of course the scenes with the fireflies bring a touch of pure magic - a heightened innocent reality to contrast the horrific realities of the war.\n\nThe greatest achievement of this film is that, apart from a couple of obviously sentimental scenes, such as Setsuko&apos;s sobbing or illness, it doesn&apos;t force any false emotion on the viewer. It really comes from your involvement with the characters. It&apos;s completely honest to it&apos;s own story and even cuts off scenes abruptly, which could potentially have been milked for cheap sentiment. It often seems to say - This is what happened, you don&apos;t need to see anymore. Another of it&apos;s strengths is that it really doesn&apos;t comment on the politics of the war in any way, just the effects on innocent people.\n\nThis is an intensely moving film and a masterpiece of animation. If you aren&apos;t moved by these characters, you really need to check your pulse. 10/10",

            "reviewBody": "Do not look at this through the prism of &quot;Foreign Films&quot;. You&apos;d be wasting your time and miss something far too important.\n\nHollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. Nothing is sacred. And rather than try to revive the New Wave or emulate Hollywood like most widely seen French films of late, &quot;Intouchables&quot; harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy, willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest, most honest and touching films I have ever seen.\n\nSy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.\n\nThe film&apos;s simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy&apos;s comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet isn&apos;t your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you&apos;ll know it when you see it).\n\nThis is one of the most unique, beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry... a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile.",

At the same time, &apos;Modern Times&apos; was Chaplin&apos;s last goodbye to the era of silent film - which, remarkably, had already ended almost a decade earlier.\n\nAfter nearly 80 years, this screen marvel still makes me laugh, cry - and think about the ongoing automatization of practically every trivial little thing in our lives. Modern times, indeed. \n\nTo me, this film is as entertaining and funny today as I imagine it was then, and it&apos;s certainly as relevant as it was then. \n\nThe tramp still rules. My vote: 9 out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

            "reviewBody": "Sergio goes Hollywood for this big-name, big-budget Spaghetti Western. Fonda, Bronson, Robards and Cardinale queue up and take Leone&apos;s choreographic direction in an epic tale of blood and revenge.\n\nFrank is a bad guy who has killed a lot of people.  He now works for a railroad entrepreneur whose ruthless sterile tracks are spreading ever westward.  The time has come for the real Americans to confront both the railroad and Frank.\n\nLeone sat down with film intellectuals Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento and watched dozens of Hollywood westerns.  From this saturation-viewing emerged a 300-page treatment which was eventually distilled into the script, penned by Leone and Sergio Donati.  There are conscious echoes of &quot;Shane&quot; and &quot;High Noon&quot; in the meticulously-plotted screenplay.  Ennio Morricone apparently sat in on the planning stage and had composed the score in toto before shooting began, the reverese of the usual process of fitting music to existing footage.  The result is a tight matching of soundtrack and visuals.  Robards, Bronson and Cardinale each have musical &apos;signatures&apos; which play whenever their characters are onscreen. Bronson&apos;s is an eerily-wailing harmonica, Robards has the plonking banjo and Cardinale the lush strings.  So intricately was everything structured that the themes were available to be played on set, so that the actors could co-ordinate every nuance of gesture to fit with the score.\n\nThe film is a grandiose lament to the death of the Wild West.  Decay is everywhere to be seen.  Streets, bars, buildings and people all have a beat-up, grungy look.  When Cheyenne (Robards) pauses beside a rough-hewn wooden post, there is little difference in texture between his face and the post.  Morton the cripple is killing the romantic West of open spaces with his &quot;snail trail&quot; of railroad tracks, leaving the fine adventurous men (Cheyenne and Harmonica) nowhere to go.\n\nThere can be few opening scenes with the visual and aural brilliance of this one.  Three bad guys stake out Flagstone&apos;s railroad depot in a High Noon pastiche.  Jack Elam (who was actually in &quot;High Noon&quot;) leads the villains.  The only spoken words throughout this long (but totally gripping) scene are uttered by the old station clerk.  Haunting rhythms raise the tension to an unbearable pitch ... the squeaking windmill, the chattering tickertape, the creaking bench.  This wonderful crescendo climaxes with the appearance of Bronson, a sequence as stylised and choreographed as a Shinto ceremony, all the more effective for the absence of spontaneity.\n\nEqual to and counterbalancing this scene is the very next one, the introduction of Frank.  This time it is &quot;Shane&quot; that gets the treatment as the McBain boy spots five men in yellow duster topcoats.  A growing sense of unease on the McBain homestead is beautifully conveyed (was the stopping of a cicada chirp ever so effective?)  A cinematic multiple orgasm ensues, with the musical theme crashing in as the boy sees the devastation, and the camera swoops round to reveal the baddie to be none other than Henry Fonda as Morricone&apos;s trademark solitary tubular bell peals out.\n\nCheyenne&apos;s entrance is also a piece of impressive cinema.  Inside Lionel Stander&apos;s strange labyrinthine tavern, quite unlike any saloon ever filmed before, the violence which hovers around Cheyenne like a dustcloud is heard but not seen, preparing us for his appearance in person.  The sliding of the lamp towards Bronson works brilliantly, the film&apos;s two good men sharing the light of humour, the symbolic forging of a meaningful friendship.\n\nBy a slow accretion, the plot reveals itself.  The leviathan of the railroad must be stopped, and there must be a reckoning with Frank. Gradually the fates of the main characters converge, and swim into sharp focus for the shoot-out.\n\nIt is not the story, excellent though that is, which lingers in the memory, but rather a hundred individual flashes of brilliance:  Claudia Cardinale (are those eyes for real?) filmed on the bed, viewed vertically downward, through a lace canopy: Cheyenne&apos;s surprise method of concealing himself on the train: Morton (&quot;when you&apos;re not on that train, you&apos;re like a turtle out of its shell&quot;) imprisoned by the armature that helps him walk: the &apos;heartbeat&apos; of the train&apos;s engine during the cardgame: the tension of the ambush preparations against Frank: the eruption of guitar music as Bronson enters the frame: Bronson&apos;s stillness and self-possession, the emblem of his righteousness: Fonda&apos;s eyes flickering rapidly in his motionless head, denoting the waning of his self-confidence: the amazing super-close-ups of Bronson: and the weird brick arch, the only man-made intrusion into the entire terrain, and the focus of human depravity.",

            "reviewBody": "Alfred Hitchcock is considered by most to be the master of suspense.  I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature, not in the perverted sense, but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism. When we watch a film, aren&apos;t we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don&apos;t realize we are there?\n\nHitchcock realized this and took voyeurism to the next level, allowing us to watch a voyeur as he watched others.  While `Rear Window&apos; as a whole is probably not quite at a level with `Vertigo&apos; (which was far more suspenseful and mysterious with a powerful musical score) as a cinematic accomplishment, it is more seductive because it strikes closer to our human obsessions. Hitchcock&apos;s mastery is most evident in his subtle use of reaction scenes by the various characters.  We watch an event that Jeff (James Stewart) is watching and then Hitchcock immediately cuts to his reaction.  This is done repeatedly in various layers even with the other tenants as they interact with one another.  For instance, in the scene with Miss Lonelyheart (Judith Evelyn), we see her throw out the man who made a pass at her and then we see her reaction after she slams the door, followed by the reaction of Jeff and Lisa (Grace Kelly).  In another scene, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey) sees Lisa&apos;s nightclothes and presumes she will be staying the night.  Hitchcock shows the suitcase, then Doyle&apos;s reaction, and then he goes to Jeff who points his finger at him and says `Be Careful, Tom&apos;.  This elegant scene takes a few seconds and speaks volumes with little dialogue.  Such technique gets the viewer fully involved, because if we were there this is exactly what we would be doing, watching the unfolding events and then seeing how others around us responded.  In essence, it puts us in the room with them.\n\nHitchcock was a stickler for detail.  For instance, he aimed the open windows so they would show subtle reflections of places in the apartment we couldn&apos;t see directly.  However, there were certain details included or excluded that were inexplicable.  Would Thorwold really be scrubbing the walls with the blinds open?  Would Lisa be conspicuously waving at Jeff while Stella (Thelma Ritter) was digging up the garden?  Moreover, wouldn&apos;t Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.\n\nThe acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the `Ice Maiden&apos; in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter&apos;s performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn&apos;t get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet, he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.\n\nThis film was rated number 42 on AFI&apos;s top 100 of the century sandwiched between `Psycho&apos; (#18) and `Vertigo&apos; (#61).  I personally think more highly of `Vertigo&apos; but it is a minor distinction, because I rated them both 10/10. `Rear Window&apos; is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense.",

            "reviewBody": "After seeing this special edition DVD which shows the entire 174-minute film (in addition to the 121-minute one that most of us had seen over the years,) my rating of this film was elevated. This review is of the longer &quot;director&apos;s cut.&quot;\n\nMost of the new footage involved the main&apos;s character&apos;s romance while he was a young man. The story then is continued years later when that character comes back to his hometown for a funeral and runs into the woman he was in love with but never was able to get for his own. It turns out to be a somewhat tragic love story.\n\nThe first part of the film, with Salvatore Cascio as &quot;Toto&quot; a young boy is a love story about two people sharing their love of movies: the kid and an adult &quot;Alfredo&quot; (Phillpe Noiret) who runs the local movie theater. Their love of film bonds them for life.\n\nThe word &quot;love&quot; is used repeatedly in this review because that&apos;s the dominant theme: the love people had for others and for the world of film, something all of us on this website share.\n\nThe second and third parts of the film are the above-mentioned love story of Toto (Marco Leonardi as an adolescent and then Jacques Perrin as an adult) and &quot;Elena&quot; (Agnese Nano/ Brigitte Fossey). The first third of this director;s cut edition is much livelier and interesting, frankly, than the last two-thirds. Although not boring, it does drag in a few spots but the longer version is better in the long run because it makes the whole story much more meaningful.\n\nIt&apos;s very nicely filmed and you get a real feel for the Italian people and their little town. The director of the movie, Giuseppe Tornatore, went on to make other great visual films, two of which I also like: Malena and The Star Maker.....but Cinema Paradiso, I believe, is considered his &quot;masterpiece.&quot;",

Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There&apos;s also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It&apos;s fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let&apos;s hope they&apos;ll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !",

            "reviewBody": "As I stated above, I think that the 2000 version of the film ought to be treated separately. The Redux is not just a longer version. It contains two new and important scenes, and one of them, the &quot;french&quot; episode, adds a whole new touch to a classic movie, WITHOUT breaking the atmosphere or disturbing the overall picture. I remember as I saw the Redux for the first time, that my whole understanding of the war in Vietnam changed, and how I had to go to the library and get an update on a few things. Also it is interesting that Coppola chose the year 2000 for the longer Redux. My guess is that he feels that the movie is as important today as it was back in 1979. He even went to the trouble of making an excellent piece of art even better, in order to actually make all the old fans see the new stuff, and to present a whole new generation with a very controversial and strong comment on one of the most bloody wars in recorded history. The movie is thought-provoking indeed, but also it has a visually very beautifully composed screenplay. Capturing the madness and chaos of war the storyline is also filled with more or less obvious metaphors and philosophical or existential riddles. A friend of mine called it &quot;the most philosophical of all movies&quot; - perhaps an overstatement - in my opinion it is just a very good film about war and the politics of war. But I can see that there is plenty for everyone here. What I&apos;m saying is that it&apos;s one of those movies that you are likely to hear distinctly different opinions about, and you are most probably going to think again and again about it. I&apos;ve seen the Redux 5, 6 or 7 times, and it is always a puzzling experience. Highly recommended.",

I couldn&apos;t be further from the truth.  This movie does things to your head that are illegal in some countries.  Portrayed (for all intents and purposes) backwards, it forces you to think in the same way that our lead character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce being more brilliant than usual) does.  Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember anything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped and killed his wife.  Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before jumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered in the same way.\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting.\n\nOverall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I&apos;m still not sure.  This film noir concept shouldn&apos;t work, but it does so wonderfully.",

Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn&apos;t sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun.",

            "reviewBody": "Over the years I&apos;ve become quite a sucker for Pixar movies and just love each and every one of them. While there are the states of the art animation and sound effects, the stories have heart. The characters are adorable yet real. It reminds one of those charming movies Disney used to make but Pixar films are very much a unique cinematic experience. \n\n&apos;WALL-E&apos; is quite unusual compared to the previous Pixar movies. There&apos;s hardly any dialogue between the two protagonists other than saying each other&apos;s name. In fact, barely a word is spoken in the entire first half hour but WALL-E and Eve&apos;s silent and playful love story is such a joy to watch. Even though of few words, both characters have strong personalities and the character development is wonderfully done. \n\nThe animation is colourful and vivid. Sound effect is amazing. The robot characters are cute and charming. The score deserve special mention as it&apos;s mesmerizing and beautiful. Andrew Stanton has done a terrific job as director and co-writer. The portrayal of WALL-E&apos;s loneliness and need for love is very well done and then the change that is brought within after the entrance of Eve and his eventual determination to rescue her is effectively shown. There are many genuinely funny and creative moments and it manages to stay away from being &apos;just plain silly&apos;. The story is rich with humour, action, drama and adventure. \n\nBen Burtt and Elissa Knight do a fabulous job with the voice acting for WALL-E and Eve. John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and Sigourney Weaver lend great support. While &apos;WALL-E&apos; tells a magnificent love story it reminds us that Earth is our home and nothing can replace it. It&apos;s a joyous magical experience and another sure winner from Pixar.",

I cannot describe the feeling I felt as the last few words were spoken on the screen. I could not look at the subtitles ( a habit of speaking two languages ) because my eyes were so full of tears. I cannot tell you how I was so sorry I did not experience the wall coming down. This film healed a wound that may have been left by the nightmare years of 1938-1945, my own great uncle being a Nazi war criminal, convicted in Nuremberg in 1946. Yes, we are mensch too. We have the potential for greatness (of character) in spite of our history. Thank you Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, for giving me back half of my lost soul in this single &quot;es ist für mich&quot;. I am reminded again that the difference between ourselves and beasts is that we have a choice.",

It&apos;s interesting to watch the film during different times in one&apos;s life  when I was a child watching this film, I thought the story was good and that Norma Desmond (Swanson) was a pretty scary lady.  In my teens/college years, I appreciated it as a certified classic and for its commentary on Hollywood.  Now, in my late 20&apos;s and early 30&apos;s I found it to have a different impact on me  I was saddened by Desmond&apos;s mental illness, and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her, so full of pity, and the care her butler/ex-husband takes to make sure she&apos;s happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20-odd times I&apos;ve seen this film. There are only a small handful of central characters in Sunset Boulevard and they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless.  There are not a lot of `dated&apos; themes in this film  the circle of life that is Hollywood isn&apos;t going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950. If you haven&apos;t seen this film, watch it because there is something for just about anyone in this film.\n\n--Shelly",

A former lawyer turned colonel (Kirk Douglas in his prime) is the voice of reason against gross injustice. This excellently staged and wonderfully acted production is as much an acting showcase for Douglas as it is a directorial masterstroke by a young Stanley Kubrick who adapted this to the screen from a novel based on actual accounts.\n\nKubrick displays a great control of sound effects and camera movement in the brief but effective battle scenes that expertly depict the controlled chaos that was trench warfare during WWI. Things get juicier during the ensuing courtroom battle where the deafening disparity between the elite who propagate and profit from war and the common citizens who suffer and die in war is shown with great lucidity.\n\nUnlike later Kubrick epics, this runs at a crisp 90 minutes, though suffers briefly from a slow and awkwardly staged opening ten minutes before Douglas comes on screen. Ultimately, this holds up very well to modern scrutiny thanks to the flawlessness of Kurbick&apos;s craft, the amazing ensemble acting, and the surprising depth of its philosophical and psychological pondering. &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; is more anti-arrogance than anti-war, and is unapologetically sentimental and pro-soldier. As such, much can still be gleaned from its message.",

            "reviewBody": "Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance&apos;s mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil&apos;s new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.\n\nAnd it is within this film&apos;s subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy&apos;s big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind&apos;s fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick&apos;s purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could&apos;ve been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man&apos;s mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.\n\nRating: 9/10",

On the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be misconstrued as rash. But Chaplin&apos;s brilliance isn&apos;t limited to making a joke out of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message wouldn&apos;t have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. Drama alone wouldn&apos;t have had the bite and resonance that this film did. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Barber) can be the best way to love them. In the Jewish Barber&apos;s final speech, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. For this reason I believe the film did far greater good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today.",

Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.\n\nAt least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.\n\nThe movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.\n\nAll in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.",

A man accused of murder, Tyrone Power, the weakest link in this terrific chain. Sir Wilfred is called to defend him, he is played by the extraordinary Charles Laughton, but he&apos;s just out of hospital - he wasn&apos;t dismissed he was expelled - and due to doctor&apos;s orders he&apos;s not to take any criminal cases. He finds Power charming and personable enough but he&apos;s not going to risk his life to save his until Marlene Dietrich makes her entrance - and what an entrance! How marvelous that what amounts to a bit of Agatha Christie&apos;s usual fare becomes such an entertaining and at times right down riveting piece of film-making.",

Now, imagine being tasked to do a sequel to ALIEN. You&apos;d be right to directly spray your pants, go throw up, have a heart attack and then politely decline. But not James Cameron. He went on and made one of the most valuable and memorable sequels in film history, despite having a lot of nay-sayers in his own team who didn&apos;t believe he could pull it off. Oh, the balls this guy had.\n\nWell, what can I tell you about this film that you don&apos;t already know? If you really haven&apos;t seen it, go watch it. Immediately. It basically is the American version of the suspenseful, British original, but it does get to expand on the world-building quite a lot, as well as on Ripley herself. Add Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton and a ton of Xenomorphs, paranoia, action, quite a bit of horror, Paul Reiser and Lance Henriksen and a badass called Vasquez, and you will have a cocktail that you won&apos;t forget, I promise. Then just realize that I didn&apos;t even mention Sigourney Weaver and holy cow, why are you still reading this?\n\nGo watch this movie!",

Iron Man\n\nWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I&apos;ve seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.\n\nAnd the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.\n\nPlus our the villains are so well done..\n\nBut I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.\n\nIt&apos;s been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.",

            "reviewBody": "This movie was a joy to watch.  I didn&apos;t know what to expect when I came into it.  I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we&apos;ve all heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.\n\nKevin Spacey plays this part to a &quot;T&quot;.  He is strong when it requires and meek when it is needed.  His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to partake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well.  I think they both should be nominated.\n\nThe support cast is also spectacular.  Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari all give great performances as the troubled &quot;Teenagers&quot; in the film. Of particular mention is Wes Bentley&apos;s performance, worthy of a supporting nomination as well.\n\nThis is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of turmoil and transition.  When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his daughter&apos;s at a cheerleading exhibition, he is completely infatuated with her beauty.  Using this as his inspiration, he attempts to change all aspects of his life.  He confronts his marriage, his job, his ego, and his libido.\n\nThe music in this film is also very well chosen.  There are moments when the music fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to present a perfect emotion.\n\nThe plot can get rather involved, but you will follow it endlessly to see where you go.  I was simply involved, hook, line and sinker.\n\nSee this movie more than once, and skip some of the other movies out now that are dare I say, trash.\n\nThis should be on the top of many critic&apos;s lists this year and it is certainly on top of mine.\n\nMy Rating (1 - 10):  10",

Kubrick&apos;s masterpiece illustrates in brilliant fashion the idiocy of nuclear war and the idiots who are orchestrating it. What strikes one most however in this cinematic gem are the individual characterisations of Sellers, Scott, Hayden and Pickens. To refer to them as memorable roles is a gross understatement. With names such as President Merkin Muffley, General &quot;Buck&quot; Turgidson, General Jack D. Ripper and Major T.J. &quot;King&quot; Kong, you know that these characters will not be soon forgotten. Other features of the film such as the remarkably designed &quot;war room&quot; set, the hand-held camera techniques employed by Kubrick and the black and white cinematography of Gilbert Taylor only add to the power and impact of &quot;Strangelove.&quot;  Quite simply, the greatest American film by the greatest American director.",

This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master.",

From a visual point of view, it&apos;s one of the best movies I have ever seen. Cinematography &amp; scenography are nothing short of perfection. 2. I had problems with the plot, some holes in it, and a general feeling of injustice, as crime seemed to be pretty lightweight compared with the punishment.\n\n2nd time was a weird situation. A girl I knew tried to get into the film school, and the day before her exam she asked me to supply her with some movies that were interesting visually. 2 films we watched were &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; and &quot;Old-boy&quot;, and, especially the 2nd 1 was a revelation.\n\nKnowing the plot, it was easy for me to concentrate on the visual side, and my friend always consumes the movies this way. Results of paying attention to the tiniest of details were stunning. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s 1 scene in there shot without an idea, without something happening in the background, or without an image responding to the theme of the scene.\n\nDon&apos;t be a baby crying about violence - camera turns away in key moments. Don&apos;t be a smartarse, picking on the shortcomings of the plot - think about Hitchcock or Chaplin and how they gave a flying f... about plot. Appreciate the work of the whole crew, and for best effects watch it a couple of times. It&apos;s worth it.",

True this is historically incorrect but it doesn&apos;t matter this film works on so many different levels... the music ahhh the music. Mozart is pure genius and his music touches this film and everyone involved. You can just sense that Mozart&apos;s inspiration drove everyone on this film to perfection. A must see film for all!",

Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname &quot;The Bear Jew&quot; for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.\n\nChristoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original.",

Miguel is a nice little boy whose family, inexplicably, HATE music and insist he never can grow up to become a musician. And, wouldn&apos;t you know it, but that&apos;s EXACTLY what the boy wants to become one day. But after destroying his homemade guitar, he is unable to enter a music contest...so he decides to take one from the local cemetery. Not surprisingly, this creates all sorts of problems...and Miguel is transported to the land of the dead. What&apos;s next? Just see the film!\n\nThe CGI for this film is simply the best you&apos;ll currently find...putting it well above the quality of competing studios, such as Universal and Fox. In addition, the scope of the images is just breathtaking....and a treat to see on the big screen. Additionally, the songs, story and characters are all lovely. One warning, however, is that this film will very likely start you crying now and again...be sure to have some tissues nearby, just in case. A must-see film.",

The acting is amazing, and the ending was brilliant. For me, all my guesses were incorrect. Everything that happens in this movie in unpredicted. The last half hour itself was highly unpredictable, and it had a powerful message. When a scene was meant to be dramatic, they did a great job at it. I don&apos;t know about everybody else, but the ending did make me cry. The message the movie sent kept me thinking for a while. The amount of courage and bravery was inconceivable, there was barely any faults or anything wrong with the movie. For a movie of 1995, they did a great job.\n\nI absolutely guarantee this movie to anybody who enjoys action and war with a bit of drama mixed in. One of the best, or maybe even the best movie of the 20th century.",

            "reviewBody": "Das Boot is not just a great war film: it&apos;s a great film period. Maybe it is true that epic themes make the greatest novels and films.  Here is a movie that explores heroism, duty, patriotism, hope, fear and the futility of war--all grand themes--explored in the confined, and collapsing, spaces of a German u-boat.\n\nI saw this film when I was a freshman in college during a weekend that I later dubbed my &quot;depressing movie festival.&quot; (The Wall and Apocalypse Now were the other weekend &quot;entries.&quot;)  Of these films, it was Das Boot that haunted me--when I laid down at night, I saw Jurgen Proctow&apos;s pained blue eyes.  When I woke in the morning, I felt as if I were escaping through the hatch of the submarine.  I could not shake the images, and now some fifteen years later, I still remember how completely meaningless the movie made everything seem, and the nihilistic message stayed with me for a long, long time.  How few films are there which affect the viewers on this level.  To say this film is &quot;powerful&quot; seems so weak a description.\n\nPart of the &quot;power&quot; of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in the direction.  So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama, over-acting, and overblown images.  Too much.  These often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level.  Here, it is the small moments which fill the screen.  Everywhere, all around is War, but for these men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital &quot;W&quot;.  It is reality, not a grand concept.  The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.\n\nStory is a 10, direction is a 10, acting is a 10 and the cinematography is a 10.  One of the all-time greatest films.",

A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.\n\nIt did have some nice &quot;moments&quot;, especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.\n\nAnd the ending...........sigh!",

            "reviewBody": "Studio Ghibli has been Japan&apos;s leading anime Production Company since the 1980&apos;s, when legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki released his first feature film &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind&quot; (1984). From the very beginning, it was clear that the Japanese director had a fantastic flair for animated film, and the uncanny ability to engross his audiences beyond the normal movie-experience that makes him the King of Escapism. Over ten years later, it seems that Miyazaki is still just as good, if not better, as he invites the world into his latest visionary fantasy, the cult classic &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;.\n\nThe film is set in Japan, during the Muromachi Era, and begins in the quiet peaceful township of the Emishi tribe, when young Prince Ashitaka (Yôji Matsuda), the last of the Emishi royalty, is wounded slaying a demon in an unexpected attack. When the tribe&apos;s wise-woman tells Ashitaka that the wound is a curse of hatred that will eventually kill him, he sets out on a journey to the west to discover the origins of the demon. What he finds is a war being waged between the villagers of Iron town, an industrious Iron-works fort led by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Yûko Tanaka), and the beasts of the forest, represented by the beautiful Princess Mononoke (Yuriko Ishida), a human girl raised by wolves, with whom the cursed prince falls in love. Soon Ashitaka&apos;s efforts to make peace are put to the test by each side&apos;s bid for allegiance.\n\n&quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is a fantastic work of art on many fronts, and arguably Miyazaki&apos;s best film to date. While some of his other projects have had the same enchantment and excitement, &quot;Mononoke&quot; has an intriguingly dark and infinitely more mature feel, established by the bloody battle-scenes and sensitive color treatment, and solidified by a complex plot and rich, interesting characters. The most obvious illustrative trait of the film is the ambiguity of the characters&apos; nature; the lack of distinction between good and bad. The ruthless lady Eboshi, while caring nothing for the forest or its inhabitants, is very compassionate towards the underdogs of her own community, such as the brothel girls and the lepers. And the wild wolf-princess, while desperate to defend her fellow forest-dwellers and protect the forest spirit, has a deep-seated mistrust of humans that even steeps into self-loathing at times. These interesting character traits make the film a lot more rewarding than many of Ghibli&apos;s other works, which were aimed mostly at children.\n\nOf course, all these intriguing themes and characters are only a part of the film&apos;s wonder, because Miyazaki&apos;s true gift lies in imagery. The detailed animation of &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is astounding, drawing its audience into its environments, from lush forest to open fields to crowded marketplace and more; the team of animators that poured their hearts and souls into this film should take utmost pride in their accomplishments. Using minimal and tasteful CGI, the movie stays very warm and inviting even when the subject matter and mood is less-than-friendly. This is also owed to the audio aspects of the picture; the voice talents involved are highly engaging and enjoyable, even in the English dubbed version, which features such big western names as Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Clare Danes and Gillian Anderson. Joe Hisaishi&apos;s music is also a rather splendid complement to the film.\n\nOverwhelming success of the anime production in Japan alone stands as a testament to its fine quality. Breaking a 15 year record held by Spielberg&apos;s &quot;E.T.&quot;, &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; became Japan&apos;s No. 1 movie of all time in the year of its release, as well as taking the title of best-selling video/DVD of all time. It is also the most expensive animated Japanese feature in history, reaching a budget of 2.4 billion. Outside of its home-country, however, the film continues to inspire and engage audiences from all corners of the globe, taking a well-deserved place in the list of cult-favorites for film-lovers everywhere.",

            "reviewBody": "... Directors of all time. Let&apos;s start with a story. Many years ago, when your grandfather was still a boy, a failed, beaten-down actor named Clint Eastwood packed up his horse and saddle (speaking metaphorically here), left Hollywood forever (or so he thought) and headed out to Europe to pick up cash wherever he could. He ended up doing a film in Italy for an almost-unknown director named Sergio Leone and an almost-unknown sound guy named Ennio Morricone. The film was (as history would later record) an &quot;Italian Western,&quot; that is, as the iconic western drama was all but disappearing in the US, it was being &quot;re-imagined&quot; by Italian writers and directors, and then filmed in Italy, using mainly Italian actors. On the set, Eastwood spoke in English and everyone else spoke in Italian. (Dubbing later fixed all that). Filming now over, Eastwood took his cash and left. Weeks later, in a bar in another part of Europe, he overheard mention that a certain film was the leading box office attraction on the continent. The name sounded familiar but, frankly, during production, a final name for the film he&apos;d just done had not even been selected. He investigated. Yes, this was the film he had just completed, now titled A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. The rest is history. Sort of. Two sequels were done with Eastwood playing the same character. Monster hits.\n\nBy this point the critics began to acknowledge not only Clint, but also the man behind the camera, Leone, who was one of the most promising directors of the era. HE DID THINGS WITH THE CAMERA THAT NO ONE HAS DONE BEFORE OR SINCE, especially his use of closeups, especially his ability to match powerful emotional orchestrals to key scenes. The fourth film in the series, done by Leone but by this time lacking Eastwood, was ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. (Eastwood meanwhile had returned to America as a major celebrity, formed his own production company, Malpaso, and over time became a director as well as the #1 box office star. Over the course of his career, Eastwood subtly voiced his distaste for Leone&apos;s work by scrupulously avoiding all Leone&apos;s trademark camera angles, even in his westerns!)\n\nBack to Leone. While he lent his name to a handful of oddball productions, the last passionate work he left behind as his legacy was this film. OMG. What a film. Showcasing not only Leone&apos;s talent behind the camera, but also his musical magic as well as his ability to tell a complex tale like no one before him. It was by and large produced in obscure locations in NA, and the performances of the players, especially James Woods, and also de Niro, could possibly rank even today as the best they have ever given. (Also a performance from a young and charismatic Jennifer Connolly that by itself is worth the price of the ticket)\n\nThe film is magical. But here is the catch. Very few people have ever seen it. Even people who &quot;think&quot; they have seen it, really have not. The studio behind the film went berserk when they saw the length and, fearful of losing dollars when they could be changing reels and selling more tickets, they brought in a butcher to shorten it. Now maybe the new editor was not a butcher by trade, but he was sure one by disposition. The late Roger Ebert said that, in his career, this was the most abusive re-edit he had ever seen. The actual film, the one that Leone left, was not seen until years later when the director&apos;s version surfaced. It is astounding. It is magical. It is one of the best films ever made. It is a must see.

            "reviewBody": "Sure, this film&apos;s plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn&apos;t amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting&apos;s genius is profoundly unrealistic.\n\nYet I&apos;m giving this one 10 out of 10.\n\nI don&apos;t know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.\n\nNot only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.\n\nYou could read a lot of self-help books, but they won&apos;t bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it&apos;s like to be scared, what it&apos;s like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.\n\nThe first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.\n\nAs cinema, it&apos;s fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it&apos;s second to none. A fine achievement.",

I know that Kimi No Na Wa made a lot of money so therefore I know automatically that the remake will come and it will be a Hollywood con job (think Ghost In The Shell SHUDDER).\n\nKimi No Na Wa to me is an extremely well written and well thought story with amazing visuals. The bond between the characters, even in animation was something else. It was beautiful.\n\nThe world does not need an American remake.",

This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence.  Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you.  I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time)  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it, for it&apos;s entertainment value, and more importantly, it&apos;s educational value.  But it leaves chills down your spine for it&apos;s honesty and unforgiving lessons.",

            "reviewBody": "It&apos;s the magic that seldom appears, whose longevity is perpetual, the pleasure of enjoying the perfections that people, music and great storytelling can sometimes offer, with the backdrop a little piece of cinema history itself. All without foul language, extravagant pyrotechnics, mass brawls and bullets ricocheting all over the place, just immensely talented people doing what they do best - keeping you entertained and allowing you to escape for a while and live with the dreams of others. Whether musicals are you thing or not, there can be no doubt that you witness greatness as you welcome the rain and it makes your heart sing.",

The laughter came often and natural. The story was even better then the previous two combined.\n\nI went to go see this with my seven year old nephew and if I laughed that much when I was his age I know I had a good childhood. The mix of humour and emotion mad this movie one of the best I have ever seen, including big ones like Godfather and Shawshank.\n\nThis movie is both hard and easy to review because you try to look at the down sides to the movie but the hard part is that there isn&apos;t any. I&apos;m sure if you shut off your emotions you could see a fault of two but when it comes to an animated trilogy this is by far the most enjoyable time you can spend in a theatre... The best part, you can bring your kids.\n\nI can&apos;t vote... in my opinion ten isn&apos;t enough!",

High and Low was adapted from the novel &quot;King&apos;s Ransom&quot; by Ed McBain, and though I haven&apos;t read the novel, the film stands up surprisingly in a completely different setting (Japan, as opposed to America).  The script is great, the cinematography is outstanding, and if you&apos;re watching the Criterion print available on DVD you&apos;ll find yourself wondering if it was really made in 1963.  This film scores an easy 10 with me.  I can&apos;t think of a crime film that I enjoyed more than this one.",

            "reviewBody": "My five children were growing up but all still at home when &apos;Return of the Jedi&apos; came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the &apos;Star Wars&apos; trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.\n\nAfter the fantastic &apos;Star Wars&apos; and &apos;Empire Strikes Back&apos; (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode &apos;Return of the Jedi&apos; was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels&apos; battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke&apos;s Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. \n\nMy wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.",

This is not just a movie, this is a story of the hardships of life told from the eyes of a beautiful boy. \n\nNadine Labaki out did herself by portraying the reality that most countries are going through in this time and age.\n\nDo not believe the negative reviews. This is not at all about refugees, they do not even cover this topic in the movie. This is about survival in the toughest and most heartbreaking of situations.\n\nThis movie should be on everybody&apos;s watch list. It is tough at times, but that&apos;s life these days.\n\nWatch it for the sake of the children like Zain.",

            "reviewBody": "When I first saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I wasn&apos;t expecting to love it, let alone like it. What a surprise when I saw it! I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don&apos;t mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.\n\nI especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot. The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography which is indeed spellbinding but also in the scenery which was nothing short of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn&apos;t have the best soundtrack/score I have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.\n\nI was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre yes, but neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing very rarely feels boring if at all, and the direction is adept.\n\nI have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&apos;s performances either. As good as the supporting performances are especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in some good films, The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy and Bruce Almighty showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here, but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress, Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.\n\nOverall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It&apos;s a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America&apos;s first &apos;art&apos; film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.\n\nAside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its &apos;message&apos; is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001&apos;s ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child&apos;s flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.\n\nAlthough 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would&apos;ve liked to be remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed.",

            "reviewBody": "After watching this half a dozen times with a biased, anti-Tarantino, &quot;what the heck is so great about this guy, anyway&quot; view(which, as most anyone watching any film with that view and a fair bit of self-knowledge will tell you, is a rather fruitless practice in pointlessness... if you&apos;ve decided you&apos;re not going to like it, there&apos;s very little reason to think that you will, no matter how good it is; you need an open mind), I finally decided to give it a fair hearing... and I saw it for what it is. An unusual film, at least for its time. A stylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music. The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating a sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told. The pace is perfect. I wasn&apos;t bored for a second, nor did I ever really want it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent, and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget, the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting is top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, this is no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel, Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well, let&apos;s be honest, it had rather awful acting. I&apos;m speaking, of course, of Tarantino&apos;s character. Now, don&apos;t get me wrong; in From Dusk Till Dawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I&apos;ve seen him act, he just doesn&apos;t seem to have the first clue. Being a film-maker myself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I can relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you just need to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can&apos;t act. Still, that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely expendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, very easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won&apos;t name them here, but anyone who&apos;s seen the film will know who I&apos;m talking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and their actions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing... something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhat drawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comes to direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is very well put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-line telling the story far better than a &quot;regular&quot; film ever could. One of the many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talked me into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someone editing films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc. - so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I&apos;m sorry, I entirely respect their right to do such a thing... and I won&apos;t claim that their doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way... but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told lies in the time-line. Also, I&apos;m a firm believer of watching something the way the makers intended it. Don&apos;t edit, don&apos;t censor, don&apos;t make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own version, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just need to comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great. Tarantino collected so many amazing 70&apos;s tunes for this film and used them great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very little keeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I&apos;ve covered here. I recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes their films with a side of style. 8/10",

            "heading": "One of the greatest wars films ever made",
            "reviewBody": "One of the greatest of all war films, Klimov&apos;s stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer, left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia&apos;s triumph over the German invaders in WW2, based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war, the propagandist use to which it was later put - when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc, citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism - does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov&apos;s shorter Larissa (1980) is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal, its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See. Through his images, the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason, if on this occasion not just one, but thousands.\n\nAt the heart of the narrative is Floyra, both viewer and victim of the appalling events making up the film&apos;s narrative, his history a horrendous coming-of-age story. It begins with him laboriously digging out a weapon to use and much changed at the end, he finally uses one. As he travels from initial innocence, through devastating experience, on to stunned hatred, in a remarkable process he ages before our eyes, both inside and out. His fresh face grows perceptibly more haggard as the film progresses, frequently staring straight back at the camera, as if challenging the viewer to keep watching; or while holding his numbed head, apparently close to mental collapse. Often shot directly at the boy or from his point of view, the formal quality of Klimov&apos;s film owes something to Tarkovsky&apos;s use of the camera in Ivan&apos;s Childhood, although the context is entirely different.\n\nThe film&apos;s title is from the Book of Revelations, referring to the summoning of witnesses to the devastation brought by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. &apos;Come and See&apos; is an invitation for its youthful protagonist to arm up and investigate the war, but also one for the audience to tread a similarly terrible path, witnessing with vivid immediacy the Belorussion holocaust at close hand. Here, the intensity of what is on offer justifies amplification by the use of a travelling camera, point-of-view shots, and some startlingly surreal effects pointing up unnatural events: the small animal clinging nervously to the German commander&apos;s arm for instance, soundtrack distortions, or the mock Hitler sculpted out of clay and skull.\n\nMain character Floyra is the director&apos;s witness to events, a horrified visitor forced, like us to &apos;see&apos; - even if full comprehension understandably follows more slowly. For instance during their return to the village, there is some doubt as to if Floyra is yet, or will be ever, able to fully acknowledge the nature of surrounding events. In one of the most disturbing scenes out of a film full of them, Glasha&apos;s reaction to off-screen smells and sights is profoundly blithe and unsettling. So much so, we wonder for a brief while if the youngsters really know what is going on. Its a watershed of innocence: one look back as the two leave and the reality of the situation would surely overwhelm Floyra - just as later, more explicit horrors do the viewer.\n\nCome And See was not an easy shoot. It lasted over nine months and during the course of the action the young cast were called upon to perform some unpleasant tasks including, at one point, wading up to their necks through a freezing swamp. Kravchenko&apos;s face is unforgettable during this and other experiences, and there are claims that he was hypnotised in order to simulate the proper degree of shell shock during one of the major early sequences. The sonic distortion created on the soundtrack at this point later appeared to a lesser extent in Spielberg&apos;s Saving Private Ryan, as did elements of a much-commented scene where a cow is caught in murderous crossfire. Klimov&apos;s camera ranges through and around the atrocities, although one doubts that a steady cam was available. By the end Florya is isolated from humanity, technically as well as mentally, by a striking shot that excludes the middle foreground. Disturbingly expressionistic though these scenes are, others such as the scene where Florya and the partisan girl Rose visit the forest after the bombing, achieve an eerie lyricism that are however entirely missing from the Hollywood production. And whereas Spielberg&apos;s work concludes with a dramatic irony that&apos;s perhaps a little too neat, contrived for different audience tastes, Klimov&apos;s less accommodating epic finishes on a unique, cathartic moment - no doubt partly chosen to avoid any bathos after events just witnessed, but one which sends real blame back generations.\n\nHallucinatory, heartrending, traumatic and uncompromising, such a movie will not to be all tastes. It certainly does not make for relaxing viewing, although those who see it often say it remains with them for years after. This was Klimov&apos;s last film for, as he said afterwards &quot;I lost interest in making films. Everything that was possible I felt had already been done,&quot; no doubt referring to the emotional intensity of his masterpiece, which would be hard to top. By the end of their own viewing, any audience ought to be shocked enough to pick up a rifle themselves and vengefully join the home army setting out to fight the Great Patriotic War - a necessarily stalwart response without limit of participation, symbolised by the director who tracks a camera through the dense forest before finally rejoining a column of soldiers heading to the front. If you feel, like I do, that any real war film should succeed in conveying the power and pity of it all, then Come And See is an absolute go and watch.",

            "heading": "why did Citizen Kane create such an impact upon its first release?",
            "reviewBody": "Well as a media student myself , i have come across this question many times in books and during lectures. There are simply 3 reasons the film, which was considered as the &quot;Mona Lisa of all films&quot; , created such a legendary appeal upon release in 1941: 1) This was Orson Welles first cinematic debut , even though he had been a huge star in theater , he was given an opportunity few first time directors were permitted to having. He had full artistic freedom and above all power, to direct , produce, write and even star in his own picture. Therefore the film industry and RKO pictures had absolutely no influence in the making of the film and were not to know what was happening on set .Of course this was bound to generate a number of problems as businessmen were curious about the nature and plot of the film , which takes us to the second reason the film caused controversy.\n\n2)One of the main reasons the film posed contentions was because the main character , Charles Foster Kane(Orson Welles), featured a range of similarities with real media mogul and newspaper journalist William Randolph Hurst . Therefore the film was seen as depicting the life , problems and personal relationships of a real person thus fictionalizing his life. Some of the similarities between the two persona&apos;s are:\n\nKANE: newspaper tycoon , worked for New York Inquirer , known as the Kubla Khan of Xanadu ,married talentless singer Susan Alexander Kane, he was a political aspirant to presidency by campaigning for governor, bought his wife the Municipal Opera House, Financier Thatcher, and threat Getty&apos;s. Hurst: yellow journalist , worked for New York Journal, political aspirant to presidency by becoming governor, married acress Marion Davies, bought his wife Cosmopolitan Pictures, financier JP Morgan , and threat Tammany Hall.\n\n-differences: Susan Alexander Kane( Dorothy Comingdore) leaves Kane later in their life however there was no marriage breakdown for Hurst and Marion.\n\n3) The last reason and most pivotal of all to why the film was regarded the way it was , was due to its technical and stylistic innovations . The film upon its release was misunderstood and unappreciated by critics as they couldn&apos;t comprehend many of its elements and were too concerned with its dark and mysterious nature which is one of Welles&apos;s characteristics in his films. The film after all was 20 years ahead of its time and was only regarded as a triumphant success upon its second release after the American Film Noir era in the 1950&apos;s. His most prominent artistic inventions were: -the low angled camera movements -extreme facial closeups -long uninterrupted shots -chiaroscuro lighting -overlapping dialogue , giving a realistic effect to conversations -subjective camera angles -deep focus shots and depth of field -flashbacks that make up most of the film All the above and more constitute to why the film is so influential to all would be film directors and for why many people regard it as the best film of all time. Lastly we musnt forget the exceptional score by Bernard Herrmann who had collaborated also with the best known director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock , and made him the chillin sounds of strings in Psycho and Vertigo to name a few . In addition the superb photography of Gregg Toland in regards to Welles&apos;s unique eye on details. After all he wanted to put in each shot everything the human eye can see if they were present.\n\nThere are many areas of the film which are crucial , these are some of the most important , and as you can see there is never too little or too much that you can add to this masterpiece .",

            "reviewBody": "This is a very interesting film on so many levels. It&apos;s interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time. Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture - Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place - what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding. Compare it with any American film from 1931 and you can&apos;t help but see the difference.\n\nThe murderer, artfully played by Peter Lorre, has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months. The police, despite all of their efforts, are unable to catch him, mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims. At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing. Then, the film shifts to two normally opposed groups - the police and the underworld. After several months of no results by the authorities, the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them, and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killer.\n\nIn a particularly well-done part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld. They discuss how they are going to catch the killer. The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released. The underworld decides to enlist an invisible group - the beggars - to follow every child at all times and therefore catch the killer. Both groups focus on the right suspect, the question is - who gets there first? M is a fascinating film that raises many topics - the death penalty, a group of criminals that are criminals by choice causing less stress on society than a lone criminal that acts out of an uncontrollable compulsion, and the motivations of the authorities often being their own bureaucratic survival rather than the larger issue of ending a series of horrible acts against humanity.",

            "reviewBody": "My favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock has directed many classics like Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo, and I will say that this deserves to be up there among his best. I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock&apos;s direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people&apos;s heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10. Bethany Cox",

            "reviewBody": "I get a bit tongue-tied talking about Hitchcock&apos;s greatest movies because they are just so remarkable, so astonishing, so entertaining, so multi-levelled, that it&apos;s very difficult to put into words what makes them great. Hitchcock made some of the greatest movies ever made, and &apos;Vertigo&apos;, though by no means his most accessible film, is quite possibly his crowning achievement. It is without any doubt a masterpiece, and I cannot fault it in any way. Every time I watch it I am knocked out, and every time I see something new, some nuance or moment that I appreciate more than I did the previous viewing. Jimmy Stewart, one of the most popular movie star in Hollywood history, gives a remarkable performance throughout, one of the best in his career. Stewart had worked with Hitchcock before, and had always been superb, especially in the much copied suspense classic &apos;Rear Window&apos; a few years prior to this, but he plays against type in &apos;Vertigo&apos; and is jaw-droppingly good. It&apos;s difficult to remember now that &apos;Vertigo&apos; is regarded as a movie milestone, that it received many bad reviews when it was originally released, and was a relative failure for Hitchcock. A lot of this had to do with Stewart&apos;s intense performance I think, and also the difficult subject matter. &apos;Vertigo&apos; is essentially a tale of sexual obsession, something most people were probably not expecting at the time! Almost as good as Stewart is Kim Novak (&apos;The Man With The Golden Arm&apos;) in a role that she will always be remembered for. &apos;Vertigo&apos; is a virtuoso piece from Hitchcock, and a movie that will no doubt continue to inspire other film makers over the years to come. However the most important thing about it is that it is still  wonderful viewing, and a movie experience that you will never forget. In my mind it is one of the three of four greatest American movies. Simply astonishing.",

The story about Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is a modern day fairy tale and that is exactly how it looks the entire film. \n\nWe have a wonderful story about Amélie who decides to help people around her, making them happy. Not by doing great big things or giving money, but by little things. She helps her father by making him believe that his gnome from the garden is on a trip around the world, she helps a lonely neighbor by just visiting him, she helps a stranger by returning something she found in her home. On the way she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) who&apos;s hobby it is to collect photos from automatic photo booths. Photos that were tossed away because people thought they didn&apos;t look good enough. He puts all those photos and pieces of photos in a big book. There is a little mystery in the book as well, of course I will not spoil that for you. The story is not only sweet and charming, it has some great moments of comedy as well.\n\nThe movie looks colorful and bright almost constantly. Even the sad parts from Amélie&apos;s life, her youth for example, look almost strangely happy. In this world, Paris actually, Audrey Tautou is the perfect inhabitant. She has one of those faces that seem to smile the entire time. She looks like she just pulled a joke and she is waiting for you to find out what it is. In a way her character is really doing that here so it does not feel strange.\n\nIn short &apos;Le Fabuleux Destin d&apos;Amélie Poulain&apos; is charming, funny, romantic bright and full of life. This is the perfect lighthearted movie.",

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve struggled a bit with this film more than any other Kubrick. The problem is that I think I get it too easily, or I don&apos;t get it at all. I&apos;m never quite sure.\n\nOne thing&apos;s for sure, it&apos;s a hard watch at times. Kubrick, taking Anthony Burgess&apos; novella and running with it, creates a main character so loathsome and charming all at once that it can create a certain dissonance in an audience (Roger Ebert&apos;s review of the original release is a fantastic example of a reviewer who simply could not see past Alex de Large as anything other than a celebration of antisocial behavior). The film jumps off the deep end from the very beginning, showing the audience Alex at his most primal and pure, an advocate of the good ultra-violence in charge of three droogs out to cause mayhem and pursue their own pleasures. So unburdened by any existing power structures at any level that Alex can simply get high, beat up other gangs, steal cars, break into houses, rob said houses, and rape women and just crawl back into the bed in his parents&apos; apartment without so much as a serious question from an authority figure. He&apos;s not getting caught by the police, so he doesn&apos;t care and neither do his parents, so it seems.\n\nThe introduction of Alex&apos;s violence is interesting in its structure. The first incident involves the beating of an old drunk man. It&apos;s filmed in shadow to help hide the particulars of the violent act, but it shouldn&apos;t endear Alex to the audience. The second, I believe, has an unexpected and subtle effect on its audience. Seemingly just bored, Alex seeks out a rival gang. When he finds them, the other gang is in the process of trying to rape a woman, and in comes Alex whose presence allows the woman to escape. No matter what Alex&apos;s intention, one of the direct results of his actions is that a woman is saved from rape. I think there&apos;s an unconscious acknowledgement by much of the audience at that which pushes many of them to side with Alex. That is undercut, though, by the next sequence where Alex breaks into the country home, beats an old man (crippling him), and cutting off his wife&apos;s clothes (while singing &quot;Singin&apos; in the Rain&quot; of course) and, implicitly, raping her. Alex is a monster, but in the middle of our long introduction to him where he intentionally does nothing good, he accidentally does something good. I suspect it has an effect on some people they don&apos;t really realize.\n\nAnyway, Alex, dealing with some internal strife from his gang led by Georgie, ends up killing a woman and turned on by his mates. He&apos;s thrown in prison where, two years later, he is the chaplain&apos;s devout assistant. In fact, our introduction to Alex&apos;s settled life in prison doesn&apos;t really focus on him. The scene is focusing on the chaplain giving a sermon and some rowdy prisoners. Alex is off to the side, manning the projector for when they are to sing. Alex, though, hasn&apos;t changed at all. He&apos;s modified his external appearance, dressing well in his uniform and studying the Bible, but he only really likes the bits about blood and sex. In his mind, he&apos;s still the same depraved monster he was at the beginning.\n\nHe jumps at the idea of an experimental treatment that promises to get him out of prison early. The treatment is that famous bit where Alex is tied into a chair, his eyes pried open, and he watches horrible things on a cinema screen. Combined with an experimental drug, Alex grows sick at the ideas of three things: violence, sex, and Beethoven&apos;s 9th symphony. He&apos;s not happy with any of the three, but it&apos;s the loss of his beloved Beethoven that hits him the hardest. The very sound of the 9th makes Alex ill and unable to function. It&apos;s around these experimental treatments that the chaplain makes explicit (shockingly so in a Kubrick film) that what I consider to be the central idea, &quot;Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.&quot;\n\nAlex can no longer chose to be bad. To a certain extent, he ceases to be human, and his return home after the successful demonstration of the treatment&apos;s effects help solidify this. His family want nothing to do with him. They&apos;ve rented out his room and can&apos;t, for the sake of their boarder, let Alex move back in. Alex finds his former Droogs as police officers after the old man from the beginning of the film attacks Alex while he&apos;s incapacitated. The former Droogs nearly drown Alex as he&apos;s unable to fight. He&apos;s become so dehumanized that he can&apos;t even stand up for himself in any way. He ends up required to rely on the kindness of a stranger, the man whom he crippled and whose wife he raped. This man uses Alex&apos;s inability to take Beethoven&apos;s 9th symphony and drives him to a suicide attempt, casting himself out of the window.\n\nRecovering in a hospital, we discover that Alex has been cured of his cure. He&apos;s right back to being the antisocial loathsome creature he started the film. The fantasy sequence that ends the film, showing Alex romping with a naked woman to a cheering, Victorian dressed, audience solidifies that.\n\nSo, is Kubrick saying that Alex&apos;s victory is being violent and psychopathic, as Ebert asserted nearly 50 years ago? No, I think Ebert missed the point. The point isn&apos;t that curing people of violence isn&apos;t a worthy goal, but that the cure needs to originate from within the person. Alex had to want to be changed, and he never wanted to change. He was always looking for ways out of his predicaments in order to get right on with the good ultra-violence. Forcing the change on him dehumanizes him. Better to do what the Chief Guard obviously thought best for Alex, locking him up forever, was probably a better fix.\n\nSo, that&apos;s a thousand words on the film&apos;s thematic exploration. After having written it, I feel like I have a greater grasp on the ideas of the film than before, so that&apos;s quite nice. I still think that A Clockwork Orange is a second tier Kubrick film, though. I&apos;ve read the film as a black comedy for a while, and it can be quite funny through that lens. The performances require a certain special mention. I don&apos;t think anyone in the film is doing a straight performance. Everything is mannered to such odd degrees, and I love them all. Patrick Magee as Mr. Alexander, in particular, tickles me. It&apos;s so off-kilter and perfect for the world yet still so utterly bizarre as to be eminently watchable.\n\nIt&apos;s smart, but I don&apos;t think it looks as good as many of his other films. I feel like having the chaplain explicate the movie&apos;s central theme twice makes the ideas less interestingly presented. These are relatively minor complaints, but when comparing this to such films as 2001, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, or Eyes Wide Shut, I have to just say that A Clockwork Orange isn&apos;t as successful. Perhaps it will grow on me more with time, but I cannot imagine ever quite loving this movie as much as the listed others with a first act that makes me cringe so much. Yes, it&apos;s intentional and successful, but still...that&apos;s a hard watch.",

            "reviewBody": "One of the finest examples of smart, satiric comedy-drama ever created for the screen. Jack Lemmon (in amazing comic form) plays a working stiff in Corporate America--via New York City--whose bachelor apartment inadvertently becomes a love-nest for amorous, married executives. The film is extremely modern for 1960 and features a non-stop barrage of funny, clever talk. Lemmon is a mad genius at frenzied (yet sympathetic) characterization, and &quot;The Apartment&quot; catches him at his professional peak in the movies. Working alongside huggable neurotic Shirley MacLaine (also at her peak) and shady Fred MacMurray (parlaying his slimeball role with curt persuasion), Lemmon creates a new kind of acting: screwball realism. **** from ****",

What a pity some of the nowadays public can&apos;t find the tranquility and maybe serenity to watch a gorgeous film like that.

Fred MacMurray, however, would never again allow himself to duplicate anything similar to Walter Neff&apos;s troubled, doomed portrayal again on screen. Playing against their dark alliance, it is left to Edward G. Robinson to win the audience over as he struggles to shed light on the insurance fraud and murder. This script should be studied by anyone who plans to write for TV or movies. Note the significant changes Wilder and Chandler made from James Cain&apos;s original novel - changes Cain admitted were improvements. Especially worthy of mention is the level of artistry displayed in the final minutes when, after an hour and a half of of bitter nastiness, Wilder gives us just the smallest spoonful of sugar that wraps everything up perfectly. There&apos;s almost something criminal when evil is such a treat to watch.",

However I have seen a lot of action and war films, and this one, to an individual who never went to war, seems the most true-to-life, taken as a whole. This IS how you have to look at this film, incidentally; trying to break it down into two or three parts and say which was better is missing the point of the film, I think. \n\nIn the same way that &quot;Trainspotting&quot; was an anti-drug film that did not gloss over anything, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; is (for me) an anti-war film that stares straight at the ugliness of war and the potential for violence within almost all people, especially those trained, conditioned, even twisted, into military roles, without preaching even a single time. Less allegory and more applicability! Wonderful! \n\nThe camera work was superb. I felt like I was walking through the movie with the Marines, from the barracks to the battlefield scenes.\n\nI have seen others criticize this film for the voice over, but I felt that it was used sparingly, and was helpful, not overdone. The narrator doesn&apos;t say anything that seems out-of-place.\n\nOthers have commented on the music, the acting, and so on, so I won&apos;t add my repetitive comments, except that the drill sergeant is perfect!\n\nThe combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined &quot;hours of boredom, seconds of terror&quot; feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL.\n\n10 out of 10, perfect.",

            "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re not a fan of musicals and can&apos;t bear listening to songs for more than 150 minutes without any dialogues, then this film isn&apos;t for you. Everything is expressed through songs and you won&apos;t listen them talking without being in rhythm. It has 50+ songs (yes, you read that right) in its 2 hour 40 mins runtime. Like other musicals, it does not have songs of a definite genre, but it comprises jazz, rap, hip-hop, acapella, soft songs and many more. Since musicals have a limited audience, it won&apos;t gain much popularity. It&apos;s a pity that films like Extraction and 365 Days get so much hype whereas a great work like this goes unnoticed.\n\nA lot of films like The Sound of Music, Amadeus, My Fair Lady have been adapted from award winning plays. But, this one did it in another way, they filmed the entire play and released it as a film. As a result, you get to be in the room where it happened and experience the magic of watching a live play sitting at home. Lin-Manuel Miranda stars in and as Hamilton along with being the writer of this musical. He does a magnificent job along with the whole cast delivering impactful performances.\n\nTo me, this is the best of 2020 so far and arguably the best musical of this century. I&apos;d even go as far as saying this is one of the best musicals ever made.",

            "reviewBody": "&quot;Scarface&quot; has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release.\n\nIt has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind &apos;The Godfather&apos;.\n\nBut it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like &apos;The Godfather&apos; or &apos;Goodfellas&apos;. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as &quot;tackiness&quot; by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the &quot;remake&quot;! \n\nAl Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana&apos;s character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn&apos;t really think much and gets angry all the time!\n\nThere is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including &apos;Gina and Elvira&apos;s theme&apos;, &apos;Push it to the limit&apos; and the title track instrumental.\n\nThere are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony&apos;s visit to his mother&apos;s.\n\nAbout the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what &quot;Scarface&quot; would be like without Pacino. I just couldn&apos;t imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn&apos;t be as effective without him!\n\nSteven Bauer shines as Tony&apos;s friend Manny.\n\nRobert Loggia is wonderful as Tony&apos;s boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role.\n\nThen there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.\n\nThe director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.\n\n&quot;Scarface&quot; is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!",

            "reviewBody": "After studying the outstanding book of To Kill A Mockingbird at school, I viewed this film, and was on the whole very impressed. Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly, considering the ages of the children who played them, and they, as with everything else in the production, are true to the book&apos;s spirit. Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch, and deserved his Oscar. The music is worthy of praise, especially for the climatic scene, and the raw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed. All of the cast are well cast, and it&apos;s interesting to ponder how much this film, at the time, would&apos;ve shocked. That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town, through the eyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor- much of the book&apos;s counter-balancing humour was left out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra), and some of the book&apos;s early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a &quot;must-see,&quot; as a companion piece to the classic novel. 9/10",

            "reviewBody": "Want to see where one of the modern era&apos;s hottest directing streaks started? If you do, then Incendies in the film for you.\n\nDirected by Denis Villeneuve, who went from this French/Canadian co-production to move onto Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival and last year&apos;s brilliant sequel Blade Runner 2049, Incendies is the Oscar nominated film that put Villeneuve on the path he finds himself on now and remains a film of substantial power these years on from initial release.\n\nAdapted from Wajdi Mouawad&apos;s play of the same name, Incendies is a multi-layered narrative that spans both numerous countries and numerous characters over various timelines but Villeneuve controls his film perfectly as the mystery that lays at the heart of this tale about family, war, life and death never gets muddled as we&apos;re drawn further and further into a film that wraps us up in its web and refuses to let us go.\n\nThere&apos;s not the abundance of filmmaking and visual flair that Villeneuve has started to become known for over his more recent Hollywood productions but Incendies power comes almost exclusively from Villeneuve&apos;s deft hand with his performers, his handling of a script that other filmmakers would struggle to bring to life and his ability to slowly ebb out more information as we go, that by the time we come to realise just what lays in store for the films characters, the power of Incendies becomes even more apparent.\n\nSaying to much about this story would be a disservice to a film that takes many various turns and pivots. Essentially at its core, a story of both twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan trying to uncover the secret of their father they&apos;ve never met and find a brother they never knew they had after their Middle Eastern born mother Nawal passes away, Incendies becomes so much more than a typical family drama as it showcases time in the conflict of the Israeli and Palestinian Holy Wars, as well as the twins journey back to their country of nationality.\n\nThe film in many ways showcases a different side to Villeneuve and proves the director is just as at home handling a $150 million plus Sci-Fi for a major Hollywood studio as he is behind the camera of a small intimate drama that is driven purely by its narrative and characters. Proof the filmmaker is a man of many talents and a director to be cherished by those that love cinema.\n\nFinal Say - \n\nFor any fans of Villeneuve&apos;s work, world cinema or powerful character driven dramas, then Incendies should be a film you seek out as soon as possible. Losing none of its power since its initial release, this sometimes hard to watch but always enthralling film is standout filmmaking and the official blasting off point for one of the modern era&apos;s great filmmakers.\n\n5 swimming pools out of 5",

            "reviewBody": "UP, Pixar&apos;s latest animated feature, is just delightful. But how do you go about extolling the movie&apos;s virtues without giving away its surprises? Like the kid at the beginning of the movie, you don&apos;t try to conquer the immovable force; you work around it.\n\nThe one clue I can give away – because it&apos;s the movie&apos;s heavily hyped premise – is that Carl Fredrickson, a gruffy old widower (voiced with gruffy old charm by Ed Asner), miraculously inflates enough balloons to use his house as an aircraft. Soon, he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with a short-attention-spanned kid named Russell.\n\nI&apos;ll also mention a couple of other items that can gauge your potential interest in the movie. One is a gag that is a take-off on a famous painting – perhaps too inside of an inside joke, but typical of Pixar&apos;s cheery attempts to appeal to viewers of all ages.\n\nAlso, part of the plot involves Carl&apos;s long-held wish to meet a Lindbergh-type adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer!). This is another in-joke that&apos;s even vaguer than the first one. Cartoon historians know that Walt Disney started in the cartoon biz by creating Oswald the Rabbit for producer Charles Mintz, who then greedily stole the rights to Disney&apos;s creation. This gives you a pretty good idea where the ostensible hero Muntz stands in the scheme of things.\n\nBeyond that, I can only offer you some enticing clues about the characters. There&apos;s a dog who&apos;s the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie&apos;s biggest laughs. There&apos;s a huge, awkward bird that is a big laugh-getter at first. Then she becomes a real enough character that – at least in the audience I was in – when she&apos;s injured, she elicits screams of fright worthy of Bambi&apos;s late mother.\n\nThere&apos;s surprising, heartfelt emotion, vivid imagery (you can almost touch the landscapes and skies), and a music score by Michael Giacchino that&apos;s practically a character in the movie – particularly in a thoughtful montage that takes Carl from childhood to widowhood.\n\nThere aren&apos;t many (or at least not enough) live-action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn&apos;t even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. The moneymen should just shut up, hand over the money, and trust they&apos;ll get a product that will appeal to everyone.\n\nUP is only the second Pixar feature to get a PG rating, only for mildly intense imagery and action – nothing off-color in the least. Again, if you can handle &quot;Bambi,&quot; this film should be a breeze.",

            "reviewBody": "&apos;Heat,&apos; a film of epic proportions on a common placed scale, provides all the essentials of a great crime drama and then some.  With a fascinating storyline, involving characters, and Mann&apos;s sometimes poetic, sometimes gritty directing, &apos;Heat&apos; is arguably one of the best crime dramas.\n\nPerhaps the most unique feature of this movie is its manifold storyline, which focuses primarily on the main characters: Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley.  Because of this complex storyline, it almost seems as if one is watching two movies, with one about each of the two characters.  While following Hanna&apos;s personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal.  Hanna&apos;s marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter is falling apart, and, as wife Justine says, he lives his life more among the &quot;remnants of dead people.&quot;  A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna&apos;s story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley&apos;s story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small).  His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with Eady, his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him.  The tensions build as Mann shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together.  When the two storylines do meet (at different points in the movie), the result is--for lack of a better word--epic.  To say that these two major storylines are the only strong ones of the movie would do injustice to the many others (following Chris and his wife, for example); but to say that they are the driving force of the movie, to say that they are responsible for transforming a typical cops-and-robbers story is the best explanation.\n\nIn addition, the characters in this movie undoubtedly make it so successful. This cast comes as close as possible to being ensemble with two such huge main characters.  And the cast is one of the best, at that.  DeNiro. Little more needs to be said.  Ever the master, his character, McCauley, can be on the one hand a ruthless robber and cold-hearted killer, on the other a warm friend and tender lover.  And, despite his life of crime, McCauley&apos;s human side shows through.  He will not kill unless he must, as seen through his anger at Waingro and bank heist.  His warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends and girlfriend Eady.  Pacino.  Equally without need of praise.  As always, he delivers an intense performance, here as Hanna, a workaholic obsessed with catching his man, while also fighting a losing battle to save his personal relationships.  He may seem just the harsh cop, but he cares about every man under his command, about his stepdaughter, and, yes, even about McCauley.  Through Hanna, Pacino shows just how torn such a man can be.  Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion, both anger and sensitivity.  Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere.  Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives.  Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who, despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film.  Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions).  Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora, as Justine, and Natalie Portman, as Justine&apos;s daughter Lauren.  As Venora is strong opposite Pacino, so Amy Brenneman, Eady, is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro.  In a cast so full of big names, it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.\n\nAnd Michael Mann&apos;s direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama.  He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly.  He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost.  Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous.  Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud, the blood is abundant, but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment.  He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic.  The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever.  Here, his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable.  And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.\n\nBecause of these and other well done aspects, &apos;Heat&apos; is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made.",

            "reviewBody": "Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. This is one of those films that you do not get tired of seeing and every time you watch it you realize a little detail that you have not seen before. Excellent actors, a good director, an impressive soundtrack and a real story are the main appeals of this film.\n\nThis film is about loneliness, about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets. The story uses a taxi driver as a metaphor of loneliness and it has some kind of irony because we can see that a city which is full of people can be the most lonely place for a man. The long nights in the city, the night environment full of whores, junkies, pimps and thieves are the main elements of the world in which Travis Bickle lives. Travis is an misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says &apos;loneliness has followed me all my life, everywhere&apos; but at the same time he seems not to do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) to a porn cinema. At the end of the film the character makes real his most violent fantasies, with a look of certain soldiers from Vietnam, and he behaves like this because of his loneliness, his alienation and because he does not find any sense to his life. The violent behaviour becomes Travis into a hero, although he had killed many people and he could do it again. Although he acts with an extreme violence the spectator understand him and the reasons why he acts that way. The soundtrack of the film, which is composed by Bernard Herrmann, inspires some kind of loneliness and sometimes it is absolutely terrifying like in a horror film. This music and the slow camera showing the streets help to introduce the spectator into the world of Travis, to know what he is thinking about.\n\nIn general I cannot say any negative aspect of this film because I have not found anything bad. Although it is a film of the 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence You talking&apos; to me? You talking&apos; to me?&apos; which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece.",

            "reviewBody": "We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born. The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Lang&apos;s &apos;Metropolis&apos; are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given. The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upper-class and operated by slave-like poor. The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens. The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God. The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan. These elements can be found in this film&apos;s ancestors &apos;Frankenstein&apos;, &apos;Batman&apos;, &apos;Gattaca&apos; and the cities of &apos;Blade Runner&apos;, &apos;Star Wars&apos; and &apos;The Fifth Element&apos;. All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Lang&apos;s work.\n\n&apos;Metropolis&apos; has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made, certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes. After its success in 1927 the film has had an uneasy time. It&apos;s pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre. One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring. Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in 1927. Unless a lost version surfaces (as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentino&apos;s 1922 film &apos;Beyond the Rocks&apos;) the complete work my never be seen again. The restored version released on DVD in 2001 was based on a digital restoration at 2K resolution from all available sources. It&apos;s the best version that I&apos;ve seen and I would highly recommend that one if you haven&apos;t seen the film. The worst is a 1994 print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration, the film in grainy and difficult to see, it doesn&apos;t even have a soundtrack. I call that one the worst because I&apos;m still a little ambivalent about the 1984 restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting (good), sound effects (not so good) and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy, Freddy Mercury, Bonnie Tyler, Adam Ant and Pat Benatar (yuck!).\n\nThose who study the film (myself included) find the story impenetrable. Some films you can easily decipher but &apos;Metropolis&apos; has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that it&apos;s hard to pin it down as a whole. Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the film&apos;s chaotic nature. It takes place in the future (restored versions offer title cards that suggest that it&apos;s the year 2000 but I don&apos;t go by that) in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers (the Gothic, sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry). The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives, dancing in their penthouses and spending their money. The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine. Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step. They don&apos;t so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses&apos; slaves building his pyramids. The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another. One person that isn&apos;t ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his office.\n\nHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the worker&apos;s children. Curious, he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there. The woman is Maria, a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be found.\n\nFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang, the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms. This leads to the film&apos;s most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs. Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzy.\n\nThen all Hell breaks loose, but the rest I must leave to you to discover.\n\nLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou. In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film (and therefore less successful), the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not. He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers. At one point Freder, disguised as a worker, witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen. Another suggests an odd device, a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around it&apos;s edge. The machine doesn&apos;t seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless day.\n\nThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism, astonishing in its use of light and shadow. One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in. Another brilliant moment comes with Maria&apos;s erotic dance as the men gawk, the camera filled with their moist eyes. This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home video.\n\nOther moments have deeper resonance. There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves. Walking to work they march with their heads down, dressed in uniforms and caps. It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps. There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler. More obvious are Lang&apos;s biblical references. The rise of the city parallels Maria&apos;s retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel. The giant pentagram in Rotwang&apos;s lab as he plays God. The breathtaking image of the plague-bringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe. The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself. There is even a Christ-like quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakers.\n\nThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Lang&apos;s insistence on no less then absolute perfection. He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster, working his cast and crew like a dictator. He cast some 20,000 extras (1500 of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone) and worked them from morning till night. The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold. Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night. Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times, once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with him.\n\nI could go on and on, this film all great films invite lengthy discussions. It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways, as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over. But when you get down to it the best way to view &apos;Metropolis&apos; is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of it&apos;s time, Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad.",

Confidential is the most classy, intriguing, thought provoking and sexiest detective movie ever to be made in the history of detective films.  \n\n When you look back at it and see that Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey and Guy Pearce actually appeared in the same film back in 97 then you wouldn&apos;t have believed it since they have all gone on to better things but before that we had L.A. Confidential which was Crowe&apos;s and Pearce&apos;s ticket into Hollywood. Spacey had already made it with his Best Supporting Actor nod for The Usual Suspects but what puzzles me is how everybody apart from Kim Basinger didn&apos;t get any acting nominations at the Oscars.   James Cromwell is the most chilled out villain you&apos;ll ever going to see in a film like this and has been criminally ignored by the Academy.   Curtis Hanson was also someone who had made some good films but no masterpieces till this came along.  \n\n They all must have sold their souls to make this because when you get big cast get together to make a Hollywood film then you become a bit intrigued by it because if the cast is big then is the story any good?  In L.A. Confidential&apos;s case it had both and a lot more to say the least.\n\nI still think that this is Spacey&apos;s, Crowe&apos;s and Pearce&apos;s best film of there career.  Russell Crowe as tough guy but sentimental towards women Bud White is flawless and is quite like the real Russell Crowe which is scary.  Guy Pearce as the quick witted but dumb looking Ed Exley is someone one you either love or you hate as the annoying rookie.   Kevin Spacey is just as cool as anything that Bogart and Mitchium could have pulled off as Jack Vincennes and there is the movie along with a great script by Brain Heagland of Mystic River fame and Curtis Hanson himself who put together a great script from James Elroy&apos;s novel.    \n\nKim Basinger is as sexy as she is going to get and her acting is very good and well deserving of her Oscar if the boys were robbed.   I liked how we had three different stories and one case that all had something to do with another but were all separate anyway till the end.   It was like watching a movie with three stories based on a trio of detectives.   L.A. Confidential was a treat as far as storytelling goes because it enthrals you into the film straight away as well as it being more exciting than a night out in Vegas.\n\nWe don&apos;t see Detective films like this so we should be grateful that this came along when it did.",

            "reviewBody": "Even if the non-action parts are a tad slow in comparison, that is more than compensated by so many things that makes Die Hard so brilliant.\n\nFor one thing the action is explosive and consistently exciting, and the cinematography is astounding being very inventive and colourful. John McTiernon(The Hunt for Red October, Last Action Hero) directs briskly and efficiently, and the pacing a vast majority of the time is exhilarating.\n\nThen there is a terrific score by Michael Kamen, some intelligent and witty scripting and a plot that doesn&apos;t feel forced or convoluted. Not to mention some excellent acting. As good as Bruce Willis is, yes his character is somewhat two-dimensional, but he is also resourceful and world-weary and Willis handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The humour is better and I have never seen people in a cinema laugh as loud and as frequently as they did here. Vinnie Jones plays a similar role as Big Chris, here as Bullet Tooth Tony. His appearance is limited but boy does he make an impact. Even when he is not on screen there is much to savour from Dennis Farina as Avi and a trio of pawnbrokers who are sent to rob a bookies. Brad Pitt sheds his movie start personna and preforms impressively as an Irish gypsie. Unlike Lock Stock.. the humour will appeal to all nationalities. However they mind some slang expressions such as Pikey and blag hard to understand. Good preformances, fantastic characters, razor sharp diologue, expert direction and camera work and brilliant humour, Snatch will make you laugh more than any other movie this year. See it now.",

This movie is as good if not even just a little bit better than the original. The interaction between Ford and Connery is amazing and makes for an enjoyable film. The action and story in this is great. This time (back to looking for Christian artifacts) Indy is out to find his father who went missing while looking for the Holy Grail.",

            "reviewBody": "There&apos;s not much that can be said about &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; that hasn&apos;t already been expressed. It is considered a great work of the Italian cinema, and looking at it in its 1999 release version, one can see why.\n\n Structurally, it&apos;s a theme and variations, with such a simple, clearly stated main motif that one can identify and follow its mutations with no effort.  DeSica is clearly the fine craftsman here, directing every scene with a beautiful sense of control and balance. \n\nHis work with young Enzo Staiola (as Bruno) is especially commendable, and he allows then nonprofessionals Lamberto Maggiorani (as Antonio) and Lianella Carell (as Marie) to act in a model of naturalism. \n\n Carlo Montuori&apos;s photography is brilliant, and Antonio Traverso&apos;s production design is pungent and atmospheric. Like most &quot;masterpieces,&quot; a film-classic score provides emotional depth in a subliminal way: here it&apos;s a romantic, Italianesque original composition by Aessandro Cicognini wraps up the entire production.\n\nDeSica&apos;s career is most impressive, being involved in nealy 200 films, 165 of them as an actor. This film remains one of his greatest achievements.  It seems to be standing the test of time very nicely, too.  It&apos;s been criticized, sometimes quite severely, and just continues to bounce back, winning new admirers with each reissue.  The public just won&apos;t let &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; fade away. That alone tends to override any negative factors. It looks like this film is going to be around for quite a while. ###",

            "reviewBody": "There are some great WW1 films out there, the granddaddy of them all in my view being 1930&apos;s &apos;All Quiet on the Western Front&apos;. Also appreciate many of the actors here, though they are in cameo roles, and Sam Mendes as a director (of the films of his seen, almost all, &apos;Spectre&apos; is the only one to not do much for me). Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman are masters in their field, Deakins is one of the best cinematographers in the business and Newman&apos;s score for &apos;Road to Perdition&apos; is a favourite.\n\n&apos;1917&apos; was seen for all those reasons. As well as because of the critical acclaim, with it being considered as one of 2019&apos;s year&apos;s best films. After seeing it, my thoughts are that the acclaim for &apos;1917&apos; is richly deserved in one of the best and most powerful films that year. It did connect a lot with me, due to watching it not long after reading the harrowing war diaries of my great-grandfather (who fought in the war and was mustard gassed and blinded).\n\nFirst and foremost, &apos;1917&apos; is a visual and technical achievement. It is beautifully and evocatively designed and Deakins&apos; cinematography, with awe-inspiring and never gimmicky use of the long unbroken one take technique, is nothing short of masterful. Mendes ensures that the tension, even in the slower moments, never slips, keeping the intensity (at its best almost nerve-shredding) going.\n\nNewman provides another hauntingly beautiful score, that does stir the emotions in the latter parts of the film when things become more urgent. The sound is thrilling in its authenticity, so much so it was like being there. The film is intelligently scripted and to me the two lead characters, especially Scofield, were easy to get behind, interesting and their bond came over as realistic. The story is engrossing throughout, it briefly loses a little momentum just before the climax perhaps, but the first half is emotionally powerful and the climax is unpredictably intense.\n\nSuch a good job is done too with showing the full horrors of war from a visual standpoint, a psychological one and in the unflinching action. Without going too far, the point of view not being hammered home. &apos;1917&apos; benefits hugely from the splendid lead performance of George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman is strong too despite his role not being quite as meaty. The cameos from Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Richard Madden and Andrew Scott manage to make big impressions in short screen time.\n\nOverall, brilliant and powerful film. One of the best films personally watched in 2020. 10/10.",

            "reviewBody": "The film deals with the history of Hitler&apos;s last days in underground bunker , it&apos;s the true story of the historic downfall and death (at age 55 in 1945) of the infamous Nazi dictator&apos;s culprit of death of 50 million people during second war world and killing of 6 million Jewish in concentration camps . The Fuhrer&apos;s last few tortured days in his underground bunker against a Berlin background . Hitler had height five feet , seven inches , eyes black , hair black , shaggy locks hung over forehead , complexion sallow , wide mustache , various hairs on each side ; besides he had marked devotion to brown shirts and old trench-coat and always surrounded by armed thugs and expert gunmen . He had demented gaze with tendency to become hysterical on slight provocation with delusions , particularly upon his place in history and his powers over vast numbers of people and addicted to public hysteria on race purity , and known to throw himself on the floor and gnaw rugs, guttural voice apt to rise to shrill tones when excited or thwarted . He was a congenital liar suffering from dreams of persecution . Almost all these physical descriptions and particulars of Hitler are perfectly incarnated by Bruno Ganz who even studied Parkinson&apos;s disease patients in a Swiss hospital to prepare for his role . Thus , he magnificently plays him as a sadistic , malicious , dangerous , vengeful, mystical and maniacal man .\n\nBruno Ganz&apos;s portrayal is the perfection in the Hitler role one would expect at least on the surface , he gives insight to his madness and with persuasive qualities of his interpretation . A flawless casting with excellent German actors such as Alexandra Maria Lara (personal secretary Traudl Junge and the picture is based on his book) as co-protagonist , Juliane Kohler (Eva Braun) and distinguished players as Ulrich Matthes (Joseph Goebbles) , Corinna Harfouch (Magda Goebbles) and Thomas Kretschman . Besides , a nice support cast who play to famous characters as Martin Borman , Alber Speer , General Keitel , General Jodl and Hermann Goering and specially Heimrich Himmler who will betray to Hitler deciding along with the count Bernardotte to agree peace with the Allies , originating his hysteria splendidly reflected in the movie . In spite of Berlin is surrounded and meanwhile the bloody war with enormous bombing fall about the survivors and last defending , Hitler prepares the sad farewell very well narrated by the director Oliver Hirschbiegel and superbly captured the atmosphere by the cameras . The motion picture is one of the best war movies ever made , on pair with ¨Das Boot (also German movie and directed by Wolfgang Petersen) and ¨Saving private Ryan¨ (Steven Spielberg) . The flick will appeal to historical cinema enthusiasts and warlike genre fans. Rating : Above average and astounding , being interesting and thoughtful .",

            "heading": "One of my favorite westerns- a fitting middle section to the &quot;Dollars&quot; trilogy",
            "reviewBody": "As the second of the three films legendary filmmaker Sergio Leone collaborated on with Clint Eastwood (not to mention his first with Lee Van Cleef and his second with &apos;Fistful&apos; actor Gian Maria Volonte), For a Few Dollars More gets well earned respect from the fans of the director and the groundbreaking star. And yet, occasionally there are those who&apos;ll not even know this film from Leone and Clint exists since it does sometimes get under the shadow of their two most infamous works, Fistful of Dollars (which for the most part introduced Clint and Leone to the public&apos;s awareness) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (which solidified Clint as a Western icon and gave Leone a similar status for film buffs). But taken as a film unto itself, aside from its place in the trilogy, this is a Western that simply delivers the goods, and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. \n\nThe story begins by introducing our two (anti) heroes, bounty hunters Douglas Mortimer (Cleef), former Colonel, and Monco (Eastwood), a drifter. They both set their sights on the leader of a gang of bandits named Indio (Volonte), who is plotting to go after over a million locked in a bank in El Paso. At first, Monco and Mortimer seem like their after Indio for the same reason- reward money- though there seems to be more than each man counted on with him and his gang. \n\nFrom the opening scenes with Cleef and Eastwood, to the scenes in El Paso, and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the Mexico desert(s), For a Few Dollars More displays the utmost skill by Leone in his storytelling, as well as in his use of the camera. Using Fistful&apos;s camera-man Massimo Dallamano, Leone does what he does best in his spaghetti westerns- he creates a perfectly in sync mood with his characters: each look in a scene, whether it&apos;s intense waiting for guns to be drawn, or just regular conversation, the look of the film draws the viewer in without over-doing it. Some points are made bold or repetitious (like Ennio Morricone&apos;s score, that keeps its whistling theme and serene watch theme completely in check), though it&apos;s not done to any degree of annoyance or by accident. \n\nIn fact, that&apos;s what makes his westerns such fun, is that you take them seriously as films, yet he always reminds you that it&apos;s all in the &apos;movie-world&apos; just by the way Mortimer or Monco strikes up a match. As for the actors themselves, Eastwood and Cleef are total pros in this genre, so ever line of dialog comes out naturally, and the supporting actors (however dubbed over from original Italian) all contribute great notes as well. At the least, it can appeal to a new generation of kids looking back to older movies, which may look at this and consider it more modernly crafted than a John Ford oldie. A+",

            "reviewBody": "Finally, after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader, the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight, I was especially disappointed by &apos;Forever&apos; and &apos;Batman and Robin&apos;. To me, these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.\n\nThankfully though, Nolan has gone back to the roots of the character, portraying a confused and angry Bruce Wayne, who ultimately rises to become Gotham&apos;s greatest champion. Don&apos;t expect to see loads of shots of Batman in this film though. It is the story of Wayne and focuses mainly on his years of training and preparation for becoming Batman. You are almost teased throughout the first half of the movie, waiting to see the excellent Christian Bale in the costume, as it keeps holding back to keep you in anticipation. When Batman does finally turn up on screen, it is well worth the wait. In my opinion, Bale was born for this role and for the first time when watching a Batman film, I enjoyed the scenes of Wayne being Wayne as much as Wayne being Batman.\n\nOne of the strongest features of the film, is the way that it manges to suck you in believe that a &apos;Batman&apos; could be a reality one day. The technology is current, with no use of silly OTT weapons and gadgets, again making the film work by today&apos;s standards. Plus, we are not allowed to forget that Batman is still just a man under the costume and there are times when he gets a bit of a kicking and shows that he can be vulnerable too, something we sometimes forget when watching a superhero flick. Gone too, are the silly villains!!! Jack Nicholson was the perfect Joker but from there it went downhill. Thankfully, in this movie the bad guys are actually fairly &apos;normal&apos; and manage to be menacing at the same time.\n\nWhich finally brings me to the cast. I always had high expectations for this film when the cast was announced. Let&apos;s face it, what a line up! Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katy Holmes, Ken Watanabe and Tom Wilkinson are not to be sniffed at. Even an old favourite of mine makes an appearance: Rutger Hauer! Awesome. Actors of this calibre would never have gotten involved in this project if they didn&apos;t have faith in Christoper Nolan&apos;s talents and thankfully they took the leap...\n\nFor the comic book fans out there, waiting to see this movie, let me assure you that you won&apos;t be upset. Imagine the darkness of the &apos;A Death In The Family&apos; and the &apos;Year One&apos; story lines. I have never met a fan of Batman who didn&apos;t love these books. Well, this is the kind of Batman you can expect from Bale: Dark, brooding and tortured by his past, yet the hero we have come to love. For those of you who are not comic fans, then just look forward to seeing how Batman should be. This film is a credit to Bob Kane&apos;s original vision and a testament to all the talented artists and writers who keep the legend of the Dark Knight alive in the comic books today....\n\nThank you Mr. Nolan and thank you Mr. Bale. In fact thanks to everyone who worked on this film. Batman finally Begins from here....",

Chaplin and 6-year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life. The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental. I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness. And I really never cry in movies. And the music...its simply Oscar-level! The movie is sympathetic, full of feeling, touchingly funny moments. It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over 80 years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age, don´t miss it.",

            "reviewBody": "What Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis do in &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; would be par for the course in modern movies  every other month, similar fish-out-of-water movies premiere with men posing as women (&quot;Tootsie&quot;), women posing as men (&quot;The Associate&quot;), black people posing as white people (&quot;White Chicks&quot;), and on and on. What makes &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; different is two things: the strength of its comedy, and the presence of Marilyn Monroe, then at the height of stardom.\n\nLemmon and Curtis turn in admirable performances both as Joe and Jerry, and as Josephine and Daphne. Tony Curtis does Lemmon one better by creating a third identity, &quot;Junior&quot;, in order to woo Sugar Kane (Monroe).\n\nTying the pair&apos;s story into the Chicago Valentine&apos;s Day Massacre, where a gang war spilled over into a parking garage, leaving a number of people lined up against the wall and shot, is a deft touch (though the serious tone of these gang sequences contrasts sharply with the bulk of the movie).\n\nThe movie does an excellent job building the far-fetched stakes of the movie ever-higher, from their finding refuge from vengeful gangs in a women&apos;s jazz band, to their showdown in the Florida hotel, to the eventual revealing of Curtis&apos; and Lemmon&apos;s identities. The movie&apos;s surprisingly suggestive and risque content is at odds with the time frame of the movie, and even with the period of the movie&apos;s creation. The many smart double-entendres and plays on words are very well-written, and alternate between lowbrow and highbrow comedy,\n\nThe films only fault might be a couple of overlong musical numbers, performed either by the whole band or soloed by Sugar Kane. Though to be expected in a Marilyn Monroe film, these musical acts are literal &quot;show stoppers&quot; that bring the comedic momentum of the film to a screeching halt. However, it is easy to over look these minor defects in the movie as a whole, because by and large it is quite funny  no wonder it s considered a classic  and after all, &quot;nobody&apos;s perfect&quot;.",

He goes from charming and funny to menacing to wholly lost in seconds. From man to child on a dime. It&apos;s a powerful rumination on a terrifying disease, bolstered by Sir Tony at his finest, a strong supporting turn from Olivia Colman, and an excellent script by Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller (based on Zeller&apos;s play). It&apos;s a daring move to tell the story from the perspective of Hopkins&apos; character as his mind increasingly deteriorates. A savvy one too, as the audience is forced to engage to truly understand what is real, who is who, and where precisely we are in our protagonist&apos;s gut-wrenching journey. This may be Hopkins best work, a late-career revelation that once again reminds us why he&apos;s one of our finest cinematic performers. Be warned. If you&apos;ve ever been touched by the tragedy of dementia, this film could wreck you.",

            "reviewBody": "In show business, there is probably an Eve Harrington born every day. Someone who butters up to a performer of note, acting innocently, revealing none of the coldhearted ambition they really have.  Anne Baxter plays this type of person to a tee.  She looks like a baby-faced fan, but little do we know, there is a fame machine at work in her mind.  Bette Davis, as Margo Channing, star of the stage, is a veteran who has seen it all.  She is quite the egotist.  Margo is a brilliant actress and she knows it.  Eve discovers her blind spot and moves in on her like a quiet storm.  This is the premise of ALL ABOUT EVE, Joseph L. Mankiewicz&apos;s masterpiece of sly wit and subtle manipulation.  Mankiewicz also wrote the picture (winner of the Best Picture Oscar of 1950) with such skill, the talented cast need only to memorize the lines and deliver them with the proper technique.\n\nThe performances are great, regardless, especially by Bette Davis and the always detested George Sanders, one of my favorite actors of the Golden Age of Hollywood.  The film is narrated initially by Sanders, who plays a ruthless swine of a theatre critic, then by Celeste Holm, the wife of Eve and Margo&apos;s playwrighter, then Bette Davis in the performance of a lifetime. The movie is about 90% dialogue, much like a play.  The words are so crisp and sharp, you never sway or lose interest.  These characters are just too interesting.  Bette Davis has a cavalcade of unforgettable dialogue. &quot;Fasten your seatbelts.  Its going to be a bumpy night!&quot;  This is the one everyone remembers, but I would be remiss to get into any others.\n\nThe picture runs well over 2 hours, but it doesn&apos;t seem like enough. Mankiewicz could&apos;ve held a seminar of screenwriting by showing this.  George Sanders is the only actor of the roster to bring home an Academy Award, and rumor has it Davis and Baxter, who was just 27 at the time, were feuding during much of the shoot and lusted the Oscar.  Time has been very good to the film as well.  1950 was a wonderful year for movies and ALL ABOUT EVE&apos;s artistic equal that year was the equally well-written SUNSET BOULEVARD, which took us behind the scenes of a tainted Hollywood.  EVE takes on theatre and treats Hollywood like an afterthought.  There are many references to the film industry, usually involving the scenes with Margo Channing&apos;s boyfriend, who is attempting to make a career on the silver screen.\n\nThe movie is highly unpredictable, especially the last scenes which tie the ideas of the story up.  There is an Eve everywhere and each character gets what he or she deserves. Fasten the belts and listen up.  This is screenwriting at its finest.",

            "reviewBody": "A very inspiring film. I walked out of the cinema feeling like there is good even in the unlikeliest of people. The dialogue was well written, and the main characters were equally as loveable. Viggo Mortensens acting was only overshadowed by that of Mahershala Ali, whose portrayal of an educated african-american man living in 1960&apos;s america was both heartwrenching and absolutely hilarious. While Mortensen stood for most of the comic relief, I found myself laughing the hardest from Ali&apos;s deadpan deliveries through the character of Dr. Shirley.\n\nThe story of a black man who struggles to gain the respect of his fellow african-americans, while simultaneously resisting and pulling at the roots of the racism and oppression which keeps him from being as successful as the americans and europeans who should be his equals by all measures musical and educational.\n\nWhile the story and plot left little to be desired. I felt one or two jokes were shoe-horned in and would have been better discarded. The visual tone was fitting to the film, but the camerawork was nothing out of the ordinary. Not all films call for out-of-this-world originality in all marks however. And this film allows the audience to focus on what is really important.",

            "reviewBody": "This film arrived in the UK with awards and Oscar nominations all around it, adding an expectation which it really didn&apos;t need adding since even without any of that it is ultimately a Scorsese film with a big name cast. It also arrives with some other stuff because the film has been criticized for near glamorization of the excesses that Belfort was able to experience with his ill-gotten funds and, to be honest, it is an impression that isn&apos;t helped when you consider that this film was put forward to the Golden Globes in the Musical/Comedy section. Now I am sure that was a political move by the studio, but it does say something about the film because indeed for most of it we have stuff so unbelievable and so excessive that it is hard not to laugh at it. It is hard not to enjoy it.\n\nAnd this is a problem, because the first 2 hours and a bit of this film is really engaging and enchanting in how much of a rush it gives you, how enticing it is and just how much vibrant energy it all has. The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, for money, for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself; I don&apos;t think the film goes out of its way to glamorize this excess and this life, but for sure it doesn&apos;t do much to balance it – and this really is my problem with the film.\n\nThe structure, subjects and delivery of this film is so inherently similar to Goodfellas that it is hard not to mention it. If you remember the opening of Goodfellas you&apos;ll remember that it opens with a memorably violent scene where an near-dead man in the back of a car is stabbed by Hill and his colleagues in a scene that is oppressive and violent but yet ends with the narration telling us &quot;as far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster&quot; and snaps to credits under a big track from Tony Bennett. This scene is important because it works as a microcosm of the whole film – the appeal but also the cost, all in one place. Wolf of Wall Street never has any of that and it hurts it. I suspect the message of the film is that our financial systems are screwed and that ultimately the rich will never be in the same world as the average person, because this is what I took from the rather sobering final scenes. However if this is the point it is trying to make then it really hurts itself with the rest of the film seeming to say &quot;so why not get on board&quot;. I know this is not the case but the lack of a &quot;point&quot; or an agenda it the film means that it naturally fills it with its own, which is a weird feeling.\n\nBut then again – I guess it is a comedy. So the infamous Quaalude scene is not horrific but rather hilarious, the scenes of excess and of criminality are not equally appealing and repulsive – they are almost totally appealing, we hardly get the other side or get to see a victim here, and a few seconds on the subway with the FBI agent really does nothing but yet again make the suggestion that &quot;it&apos;s all broken so why not at least get rich yourself&quot;. Getting away from this, it is a well made film. Scorsese makes this award season&apos;s second film to owe a massive debt to Goodfellas (American Hustle being the other) and he directs the film with energy; music is used well as one would expect and the editing makes the film pop. DiCaprio is great in the lead – OK he doesn&apos;t find the heart of the character, but the film doesn&apos;t ask him to. Instead he is charismatic and energetic, drawing the viewer in and giving the film its energy. The supporting cast is deep with names and familiar faces and it is a statement about how well the film holds the viewer, because it isn&apos;t distracting no matter how many famous faces or supporting character from TV appear (although I did notice that this and American Hustle had lots of faces from HBO&apos;s Boardwalk Empire). Jonah Hill is over the top in a way that works, although I am surprised to see him getting an Oscar nomination for it in such a crowded year.\n\nWolf of Wall Street has had a lot of praise and this will continue as the Oscars approach and are awarded. Personally I enjoyed the film as a funny true story delivered with energy and excess but in many ways it is not Goodfellas and the most important of these is that the film lacks a moral core to itself, to its characters and to its message. I don&apos;t mind the &quot;it&apos;s all screwed so who cares&quot; message that it ultimately seems to give, but I didn&apos;t feel comfortable with how wide a smile it had on its face while it was delivering it.",

He won an Oscar for his screenplay, and it was well deserved.\n\nMaximilian Schell was simply fantastic, as was Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, and Judy Garland. Director Stanley Kramer brought out the best in these actors, and others like Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, William Shatner, and Werner Klemperer.\n\nDon&apos;t look upon it as three hours of cinema, but as a class in humanity as only Abby Mann could write.",

Shakespeare wrote King Lear as a mirror on the human condition. We do not have to be kings and princesses to identify with the father&apos;s desire for the well being of his children, even if his own life was one of cruelty and pain. We see this theme throughout great literature and film. What Ran has done is to provide the viewer with many small moments within the pain to realize the beauty. Even the moment of epiphany for Hidetora, when his actions achieve his madness, is one of surpassing beauty. As the storm rages outside the small house of the prince he blinded, whose parents he killed, whose sister he forcibly married off, the simple sounds of the flute provide an intense focus on the here and now. It is at this moment when Hidetora recognizes that he himself sowed the seeds of his own destruction. There is no dialogue, no swashbuckling, just the terrible beauty of the music. As with many of Kurasowa&apos;s films, despite their epic scope, it is the small paint strokes that make up the master&apos;s canvas.",

Innocence and brutality, fantasy and reality, together in a wonderful fairy tale about the power of magic in dark times. The performances are great, mainly from Sergi López, Maribel Verdú and the big revelation of the film: the 12 years girl Ivana Baquero. Del Toro repeats the context of the film &quot;El Espinazo del Diablo&quot; (&quot;The Devil&apos;s Backbone&quot;), the Spanish Post-Civil War, with the same philosophy: the supernatural invading the daily life in a depressive environment and the innocence of children trapped between both world. But &quot;El Laberinto del Fauno&quot; is most compact, most mature and best done in very aspects, and perhaps it&apos;s the most personal movie from Del Toro.",

            "reviewBody": "William Munny (Clint Eastwood taking the lead and directing the piece) is an old and retired gunman whose past misdemeanours would make the devil himself seem tame. Widowed and struggling to raise his two children on a paltry farm, he&apos;s tempted out of retirement for one last pay dirt job, the consequence of which provides violence - both physically and of the soul.\n\nClint Eastwood signed off from the Western genre with this magnificent 1992 picture, the appropriation and irony of which is in itself a majestic point of reference. After the script had been knocking around for nigh on twenty years (written by Blade Runner scribe David Webb Peoples), Eastwood seized the opportunity to play William Munney and lay bare the mythologies of the Wild West.\n\nIt&apos;s striking that the makers here have lured us in to being firmly on Munney&apos;s side, we are, incredibly, influenced by Eastwood&apos;s part in the history of the Western. In spite of Munney&apos;s obvious murky past (despicable crimes they be), we wait (and hope) for Munney to make a quip and way lay the bad guys - in fact salivating at the prospect is probably closer to the truth. So it&apos;s with enormous credit that Eastwood, and his magnificent cast and crew, manage to fuddle all our respective perceptions of the West and the characters we ourselves have aged with.\n\nIt&apos;s not for nothing that W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is one of the critical characters on show, this even though we didn&apos;t expect that to be the case. Beauchamp is a writer of penny pulpy novels that tell of derring-do heroics, gunslingers with a glint in their eye who deal death as some sort of heroic encore. This gives Unforgiven an excellent sleight of hand, for this West is grim and a destroyer of all illusions and it&apos;s not controversial to say that this is indeed a good thing.\n\nEastwood is greatly served by the actors around him, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman (winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a script he turned down many years before!), Rubinek, Frances Fisher, Anna Thomson, Jaimz Woolvett and an incredible cameo from Richard Harris. Along with Hackman&apos;s win for his brutally tough portrayal of Sheriff &quot;Little Bill&quot; Daggett, Unforgiven also won Oscars for Eastwood for his clinically tight direction, Best Picture, Best Editing and it was nominated in another five categories. One of those nominations was for Jack Green&apos;s cinematography, which now, in this age of High Definition enhanced cinema, can be seen in all its wonderful glory. The Alberta location is magically transformed into the Western frontier, with the orange and brown hues a real treat for the eyes.\n\nUltimately though, Unforgiven is a lesson in adroit film making, where across the board it works so well. Why? Well because the man at the helm knows this genre inside out, he was after all the sole flag bearer for practically 25 years. He learnt from his peers, and thus Eastwood has crafted a thematically complex piece that for all its violence, debunking and melancholy pulse beats, is a film that is as beautiful as it is most assuredly stark. An incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema, regardless of being a genre fan or not. 10/10",

It has everything you could want from a great Hollywood movie: subtlety, excellent acting, a thoughtful and intelligent script and quite wonderful cinematography.\n\nIt&apos;s a film in which the oil is a supporting character in itself, and the series of unfortunate deaths and accidents that beleaguer our leading man reminded me of Emile Zola&apos;s excellent novel, Germinal. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another assured performance here, living and breathing rather than merely acting his role, and watching his growing feud with the slimy preacher is the stuff of great cinema. All in all a wonderful, epic film, old fashioned in the best possible sense.",

Jim Carrey plays an excellent role as a man with whom you can emphasize as well as be entertained by.  The film&apos;s surrealistic nature is frightening when the viewer realizes the legal feasibility in today&apos;s society, and it offers a great message about who or what we assume God to be and how He (he?) would react to our personal drives for discovery to challenge a world we treat as an aquarium.  Some things to note and ponder: The way the real-life viewers ignore the real lives of their compatriots and customers while focusing on a false life on screen; whose life is more real and whose is worth living?  Also, note that Christof does not have his name listed among the &quot;real world&quot; in the credits, but in &quot;Christof&apos;s World.&quot;  His high-profile media-driven life is no different from Truman&apos;s!",

            "reviewBody": "When I first saw The Sixth Sense, I didn&apos;t know what to expect. I guess I was looking forward to a good scary horror flick.  I was very surprised. I found that the purpose for this movie was far greater than just trying to scare the audience.  I found this movie was showing not only the emotions of fear, but also faith, commitment, sadness of loss, and love.  The end was so surprising, I had to see it again.  The second time I watched it, I did it from a totally different perspective (this is a very rare quality for any movie), and I enjoyed it just as much, or maybe even more. I also, as many viewers have, tried to detect fallacies in the story.  I couldn&apos;t find one. In addition, for those that appreciate great soundtracks, the music only helps to heighten the experience of the movie.\n\n I believe that a great movie is one that helps the viewer perceive life and the world differently.  The Sixth Sense is one of those extraordinary movies that does that to me.  This movie reflects on some difficult subjects that will make the viewer walk away asking eternal questions.  Questions about death, about letting go, about eternal love and commitment, about the love between parent and child, and between husband and wife.  Maybe I read too much into this very wonderful film, but I believe it will be difficult to find a movie that has touched on these subjects so poignantly and so well for years to come.",

            "reviewBody": "Similar to my rating for this film, you can argue that 9 out of 10 people who watch this movie, it will not be their first Scorsese film. Most of us know the genius that he is and coming into this showing we should expect brilliance, and gladly he delivers a captivating storyline driven by great acting. Unfortunately with the release of Shutter Island was also a press release that Taxi Driver may be remade, so that news made me hesitant to care, but I&apos;m glad I was wrong.\n\nShutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshall sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn&apos;t comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy&apos;s wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don&apos;t think this film would be the same without them.\n\nEven to begin explaining details of the plot and how everything comes to fruition causes me to feel migraines alike the ones Teddy gets in the movie, therefore I won&apos;t ruin anything for you now. Take my honest word that if you enjoyed any Scorsese movie in the past or have enjoyed movies that include surrealism, Shutter Island combines the two into an intense thriller that boggles the mind and possibly even &quot;corrode it, rusts it&quot;. Also, if you are hesitant to watch this film because the trailer perceives it as a horror film with a lot of &quot;jumpy&quot; scenes, ignore that. I had the same feeling entering it, and there was only one towards the very end, but it was worth the shock. You will miss so much detail trying to cover your eyes for a few minutes sporadically throughout that it&apos;s not worth it. Take the risk of jumping out of your seat for once, because it was the best scare I could ask for.\n\n9/10. Not Martin&apos;s best work, but come on, could you make a better movie than him?",

This guy&apos;s amazing!\n\nI&apos;ve been exploring the halls of Kurosawa and it&apos;s getting hard to leave. Yojimbo is a FUN film to watch.  Toshiro as the samurai steals almost every scene he is in and I think the epitome of his character  is when he&apos;s in Gonji&apos;s place lying on the floor.  He doesn&apos;t brag, but when he goes into action, that&apos;s it!  As soon as he enters the chaotic town, he doesn&apos;t seem fazed at all and actually enjoys it.  His  demeanor is really amusing and it&apos;s great watching his plan unfold;   how he manipulates both groups to get his way (it&apos;s really funny).  Great thing too is he&apos;s not really a hero and he&apos;s not entirely a villain.  He doesn&apos;t hesitate to kill, but does so methodically.  You also have &quot;characters&quot; including Gonji, the thugs from both sides, and Unosuke with an ace up his sleeve (or robe?) which makes things really interesting.\n\nYojimbo&apos;s mix of dark humor, action, and a great performance from Mifune make for a Kurosawa classic.",

            "reviewBody": "I do know, however, that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the funniest movies ever made. Let&apos;s face it, if the Python hadn&apos;t showed up in 1969, someone would have created them by now, or the world would be a much sadder place. Alongside Life of Brian, which is the sextet&apos;s masterpiece, Holy Grail is an excellent start if you want to get addicted to their surreal humor.\n\nAs suggested in the title, the film deals with the Arthurian stories, freely reinterpreted by the Python ensemble: after recruiting his knights, including Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Robin (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones) and Sir Galahad (Michael Palin), King Arthur (Graham Chapman) embarks on a mission from God (also Chapman, voice only though): to seek and find the Holy Grail. No need to say, the journey is going to be perilous, but also hilarious, our heroes doing their &quot;best&quot; to screw everything up.\n\nAs in Life of Brian, there are so many good bits choosing just one or two feels reductive and disrespectful, given the material. It&apos;s pure comedy gold from start to finish, a non-stop gag marathon: from the mock Scandinavian subtitles in the opening credits to the argument about swallows, from the Killer Rabbit to the Black Knight and the jaw-dropping epilogue, you will keep grinning like never before (if you&apos;re unfamiliar with these comedians, that is). Actually, after some serious thinking I can select two particular sequences as particularly memorable: the Knights who say &quot;Ni!&quot; and the Bridge of Death. The rest of the film is ace too, but those two scenes are the ones I can&apos;t stop thinking of fondly whenever the movie is mentioned.\n\nOh, and let&apos;s not forget Terry Gilliam&apos;s vital contribution: he doesn&apos;t appear that much as an actor (his Bridgekeeper is absolute genius, though), but he compensates that with the remarkable animations used to depict part of this epic adventure. Speaking of epic, this picture has one of the most brilliant tag-lines in comedy history, if not film history in general.\n\nOh yes, the world wouldn&apos;t be quite the same without the Monty Python. Even the most miserable person on the planet will laugh like a lunatic after viewing any of their films.\n\nP.S. Ni!",

            "reviewBody": "In the 1920&apos;s, labor was hard to find. If you happened to be a laborer, work was almost non existent. Indeed, if you were unemployed and in Mexico, your chances were dismal. Yet, these were the times, which attracted many South of the border. The place was barren, yet many a fortune could spring up directly before you, . . .if you were luckily enough to see it. That is the story behind this incredible film. The legend of El Dorado was only one of the many myths which lured the adventurous to Mexico, another was &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.&quot; The gold of the Mother of Mountains was passed from father to son for generations. Thus when the film adaption was made, it was sure to be sculpted by men of vision. One such man is legendary John Huston who directed this film. Three common men are lured by the promise of discovering a lost treasure. The first is Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a nice enough guy who wants only to be fair, but is hungry to &apos;strike it rich.&apos; The second is Howard, (Walter Huston) as honest as you expect him to be and a man of considerable experience. The last is Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) who if given a chance, will use it. The trio make a PAC to share and share alike all the treasure they find. However, only Howard is aware of what the possession of Gold can do to a man. To find the treasure, they need the mountain, some hard work, a little luck. To bring it home, will require something only one of them possesses. The film is a Classic and is due to the combined talents of all the stars and the director. If you look closely, you&apos;ll see Robert Blake (Barreta) and John Huston in brief roles. ****",

            "reviewBody": "In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.\n\nThe plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn&apos;t seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn&apos;t the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.\n\nThis is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn&apos;t even in the top 250. Today, people don&apos;t appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90&apos;s, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn&apos;t understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.\n\nThis spawned two sequels. The second one wasn&apos;t bad, but the third wasn&apos;t very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.\n\nThe story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone&apos;s life is at stake.\n\nThe special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.\n\nYounger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren&apos;t scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.\n\nI highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.\n\nWatch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.\n\nEnjoy",

People prefer to live a lie than admit the truth, very reminiscent of today&apos;s world. The characters are talking to us, we are the jury.\n\nThe performances are amazing, nothing acting is so good, blows away today&apos;s competition.\n\nThe film score is stunning as well, one of my favourites from a Japanese film.\n\nThe direction is breathtaking, the jungle is beautifully lit, it has a sense of horror to it. Black and white was the perfect choice.\n\nOverall, an amazing film from a genius!",

            "reviewBody": "Pros: 1. The bright colour palette does a wonderful job at highlighting the over-the-top nature of the film. 2. The entire animated sequence of the O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) origin story is gorgeously animated, as well as being impactful and brutal. 3. The score envelops the movie in a pulsating lively aura, and adds reems of energy to the scenes. 4. The action and fight scenes are incredibly entertaining and brilliantly choreographed. 5. The editing is mostly top-notch, especially with the quick cuts adding a lot of vibrancy to the fight scenes. 6. The costume and set design create the outlandish world perfectly. 7. Both Uma Thurman (The Bride) and Lucy Liu deliver great performances. 8. The sound-mixing is very crisp and clean, and it adds so much weight to the action scenes. 9. The make-up and art production is off-the-charts and, in regards to the gore, helps to make the deaths to feel more potent in their execution.\n\nCons: 1. The slow-motion used is extremely unattractive and pointless. 2. There is annoying minor usage of stock action screams.",

            "reviewBody": "No Country for Old Men won four Academy Awards in 2007, including Best Picture and Best Director(s). Despite the critical acclaim, the Coen Brother&apos;s adaptation of Cormac McCarthy&apos;s novel was probably a bit of a head-scratcher to many people.\n\nThe film&apos;s narrative begins in familiar fashion, introducing you to the main characters and setting up the plot using recognized, established filmic devices. Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon a suitcase filled with cash and wants to keep it for himself. Anton Chigurh is the sociopath who will stop at nothing to get the cash back. Ed Bell is the Sheriff tasked with bringing Chigurh to justice and, it is presumed, keeping Moss and his wife, Carla Jean, from danger. In addition, there&apos;s a corporate backer, a hired gun, and a Mexican gang who are also after the cash (i.e., the McGuffin). So much for the usual narrative elements.\n\nWhen the film continues far beyond the point that the expected narrative structure breaks down, viewers are left to grasp at what the film is actually about. What, if anything, is this film trying to say?\n\nI propose that the film is, among other things, a meditation on the impotence of human and divine systems of justice in light of unflinching, unrelenting, random, radical evil. There are a number of elements in the film that indicate such a meditation, but one need not look much further than the meditations of Sheriff Bell, whose words begin and end the film. Consider:\n\n&quot;There was this boy I sent to the &apos;lectric chair at Huntsville Hill here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killt a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn&apos;t any passion to it. Told me that he&apos;d been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he&apos;d do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. &apos;Be there in about fifteen minutes&apos;. I don&apos;t know what to make of that. I sure don&apos;t. The crime you see now, it&apos;s hard to even take its measure.&quot; \n\nWith these words, the film&apos;s &quot;story line&quot; unfolds, with Sheriff Bell trying, and failing, to be effective.\n\nAt the end of the film, the retired Sheriff Bell describes a dream to his wife:\n\n&quot;It was like {my father and I} was both back in older times and I was on horseback going&apos; through the mountains of a night. Going&apos; through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on going&apos;. Never said nothing&apos; going&apos; by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin&apos; fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. &apos;Bout the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was going&apos; on ahead and he was fixin&apos; to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up.&quot; \n\nThe film is nihilistic in both structure and content. If you would like to force a less despairing ending, Bell&apos;s dream could be interpreted as a ray of hope: a light shines in the darkness! On the other hand, it is a dream that he wakes up from.\n\nI don&apos;t know what to make of that. I sure don&apos;t. But that doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t try.",

This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It&apos;s a dark, brutal, and claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from the genius of John Carpenter.",

            "reviewBody": "If one was to turn on David Lynch&apos;s The Elephant Man midway through, without knowing what it was, one might be startled at the appearance of the main character. One might even be tempted to make fun of the character. But if one was to watch the film from the beginning, one&apos;s sympathy with John Merrick (John Hurt), &apos;The Elephant Man,&apos; would be strong enough to deny that the former situation was ever a possibility. Lynch does not allow his audience to glimpse Merrick sans mask until his appearance has been built up substantially. When we the audience are at our zenith of anticipation, we see him-no dramatic music, no slow motion; a simple cut and he&apos;s there. There he is. And it&apos;s no big deal. \n\nThis is the beauty of Lynch&apos;s direction. We are led through our morbid curiosity at the same rate the characters in the film are. We develop alongside them. More specifically, we develop alongside Frederick Treeves, played with an astounding sublimity of emotion by Anthony Hopkins. Next to Treeves we pity Merrick, respect him, pity him again, and then ask ourselves with him, &apos;is he just a spectacle to me? Am I a bad person?&apos;\n\nLynch certainly doesn&apos;t let us bypass this question easily. Are we bad people for being intrigued or are we good people for pitying? Certainly there is a mix of intrigue and pity with every character who first meets John, and we are not excluded. However, as with almost every character who truly comes to know John and confer with him, we learn to respect him as a human being and not as a spectacle. Nonetheless, this issue never finds close in the film, nor do I feel it ever can be closed in actual life. Hopkin&apos;s Treeves is never fully sated in how he feels about this dilemma, and so, neither can we be.\n\nTechnically, The Elephant Man is a beautifully shot film. In crisp black and white, the film recalls the cinematic technique of American cinema circa the 1930&apos;s. The scenes dissolve into one another; there is no brisk editing. The lighting is kept low-key during dark scenes, balanced during daytime scenes-this is standard film-making of the era. The one digression from this form are the distinctly Lynchian surrealities-pseudo-dream-sequences of commendably original imagery that break up the film and serve as distinct mood-setters for the audience. These are, for the most part, fairly intimidating sidenotes. We as an audience are caught off-guard because in these tangents we are not identifying with Treeves, we are put instead into Merrick&apos;s shoes. It is unsettling.\n\nBut Lynch has never been a director to flinch at unsettling prospects. We must watch Merrick beaten, abused, harassed, humiliated, and tormented. We may feel a surge of happiness when he finally stands up for himself, but by that point we still have to cope with what we&apos;ve already, what he&apos;s already, experienced. I suppose that is the greatest and most devastating aspect of the film-empathy. Every moment is heartbreaking. Yet no matter how hard it gets, and how much better it then turns, there is always the threat of another jab. And those jabs only get more and more painful.\n\nThe Elephant Man is a perfect film. It is sorrowful but it apologizes not at all for it. It is a film about where our empathy stems from, a film that asks you to feel sorry but rebukes you for your blind pity. It asks you to respect Merrick, not cry for him. But you can&apos;t help crying. The Elephant Man is a film that treks you through despair and asks for your hope in the end. It asks you to hate humanity but to love the humane. It asks you to look at a man who appears sad and know that inside, he&apos;s okay.",

That year several films were successes which consisted of Francis Coppula&apos;s &quot;The Godfather:Part II&quot;,Alan Pakula&apos;s political thriller &quot;The Parallex View&quot;,Robert Aldrich&apos;s &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;,and not to mention the disaster epics of the day;Irwin Allen&apos;s &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;,and Mark Robson&apos;s &quot;Earthquake&quot; not to mention the films &quot;The Conversation&quot;,and &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;,&quot;Lenny&quot;,and &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; to name a few. But one film in particular stood out from all the rest and it shows why that was one of AFI&apos;s 100 top films of all time.\n\nThe year was 1974. The motion picture is &quot;Chinatown&quot;. This was the movie that cemented Jack Nicholson as a bonafide superstar throughout the entire decade of the 1970&apos;s. This was the movie that started it all.\n\nJack Nicholson graduated from star to superstar playing a gumshoe in this marvelously intricate film noir of the 70&apos;s directed by Roman Polanski,who has a memorable cameo as a sadistic hood,gives Nicholson the most famous nose job in motion picture history. Robert Towne&apos;s Oscar winning script(whom they used in some acting and writing classes as a learning tool in some colleges)brilliantly depicts 1940&apos;s Los Angeles as a glittering cesspool of murder,incest,and corrupt land deals. Faye Dunaway steals the picture with a haunting performance as the film&apos;s alluring female fatale,and John Huston,as her creepy millionaire father,will make your skin crawl. The stunning finale still packs an emotional wallop. &quot;Chinatown&quot; was the apex of what the cinema of the 1970&apos;s was about to become,and this was the prime factor of that as well.\n\nThe film was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture and won three for Best Original Score(Jerry Goldsmith),Best Screenplay(Robert Towne),and Best Supporting Actor(John Huston).",

            "reviewBody": "The story of boxer Jake La Motta from his rising star in the 1940&apos;s through to his own downfall and his eventual living on the cabaret circuit in the present day.\n\nScorsese and De Niro  nobody needs say any more.  Whether it be media satire (King of Comedy), small time thugs (Mean Streets) or real gangsta s**t (Goodfellas), the two rarely miss.  This was one of their best to date (and probably for ever).  The story is fascinating in itself but as an examination of masculinity it excels.  The film allows us to watch a man who goes along with all the things he thinks make him a man  even when those characteristics and habits begin to destroy everything he has  his marriage, his realtionships and his career.  Combine this with the gripping boxing tale of ups and downs and you have a film that never outstays it&apos;s welcome.\n\nScorsese is on top form  the use of black and white any have been a quality issue, but he uses it well.  The fight scenes are other worldly  exaggerated to the extent that it is breathtaking and more shocking than previous boxing scenes in other movies. My favourite effect is the sound editing in the fights where silence and calm seem to descend just before key moments..amazing.  The relationship stuff is also gripping and Scorsese handles he human cost just as well as he shows us the physical beatings.\n\nDe Niro is amazing  the method stuff alone is great, but his whole performance is intense.  Similarly Moriaty, Pesci and Frank Vincent are excellent  however they all stand in De Niro&apos;s shadow.\n\nOverall  an excellent film on so many levels, as a story, as a examination of masculinity, as a sports film, as a lesson in direction and editing..this excels in so many ways  may it never drop out of the top ten from the twentieth century!",

            "reviewBody": "This film shows the best of the American cinema. Whether we like the film, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this film.\n\nThe vision of David O. Selznick, the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell&apos;s massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being, despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the war.\n\n&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; brought together the best people in Hollywood. The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen. Of course, credit must be due to the director, Victor Fleming, and his vision, as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard, who gave the right tone to the film. The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war, and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta. The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie.\n\nOne can&apos;t conceive another Scarlett O&apos;Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. Ms. Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows. Scarlett goes from riches to rags, back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didn&apos;t know she possessed. Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her, Rhett.\n\nThe same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man&apos;s man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency. His love for Scarlett, the woman he knows is in love with a dream, speaks eloquently for itself.\n\nThe other two principals, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard, give performances that are amazing to watch. Ms. de Havilland&apos;s Melanie Hamilton is perfect. Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley. Mr. Howard&apos;s Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife, while Scarlett keeps tempting him.\n\nThe rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen, but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful. Ms. McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing. This huge talent is a joy to watch.\n\nComments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie, but being realistic, this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities, such as the slavery, were the norm of the land. While those things are repugnant to acknowledge, in the film, they are kept at a minimum. After all, this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South, Margaret Mitchell, who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind, no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American history.\n\nEnjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor.",

            "reviewBody": "For some reason, I couldn&apos;t quite catch this movie in theaters and I managed to watch it on an international flight. And boy, am I glad I did! \n\nAs far as concepts go, I was astonished at the amount of detail and coherence in execution. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the colors rich and vibrant, the characters utterly memorable and some of the most poignantly heart-breaking lines of dialogue ever spoken/sung in any movie, let alone feature animation. It is every bit a Disney-Pixar classic and as emphatic a return to form as it can get.\n\nThe story revolves around a young girl child who is happy in her world and has to suddenly acclimatize to another environment when her family has to move. Growing pains and social issues affect her while she grapples with increasingly complex situations, both at home and school. Meanwhile, the interplay between the five primary emotions inside her mind is both dynamic and fraught with compromises, much like how we deal with others everyday. As things come to a head and young Riley is about to make a life-changing decision, the events that follow leave a lasting impression, with an increased appreciation of the phrase &quot;emotions are what makes us human&quot;! \n\nI recognized some dichotomies - for instance, Minnesota, usually perceived cold, is regarded as warm and comforting by Riley while San Francisco, renowned for its sunny weather, is seen as foreign and unwelcome. The other contrast I noticed was all five emotional figures (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust) do not always stay true to form, with Joy especially exhibiting nuances far beyond what her name implies - case in point, her touching admission preceding the last act (that entire sequence was too much for my eyes to take, by the way). All this might be considered a tad too much for young children to appreciate, but with time, they may probably realize how beautifully honest this movie was in trying to portray their growth and the underlying issues.\n\nCertainly, it is not without flaws: the plot meandered a bit 2/3rds into the length; Joy&apos;s &quot;A-ha&quot; moment seems strangely contrived, despite the impact it had; the music was adequate but not truly captivating as in the case of other Pixar offerings. But the beauty of this medium is that it offers filmmakers opportunities to steer audiences to more engaging experiences; Pete Docter and Co accomplish this with aplomb.\n\nIn terms of cast and crew, the voice actors are superb selections - Lewis Black aces the Angry persona with generous dollops of sarcasm; Mindy Kaling is just perfect voicing Disgust; Richard Kind&apos;s performance as the imaginary Bing Bong is an absolute tear-jerker, while Kaitlyn Dias shows remarkable poise playing Riley. But it is Amy Poehler who steals the show in a coruscating blend of vivacity, vibrancy, and vicariousness. Her Joy is not an infallible leader, but one who accepts others in the face of challenging situations and plows ahead with inspiring positive energy. The animation left me spell-bound, especially the sequence where thoughts are shown to be abstracted, and are endowed with a lot of heart. The movie is fairly short, but a running time of 94 minutes is appropriate justice to a slightly heavy subject matter. The humor compensates with trademark Pixar staple of jokes, albeit intended for slightly more mature viewers. Pete Docter gave us the outstanding Up six years ago and ably accompanied by Ronnie del Carmen, has categorically demonstrated that he is a fabulous storyteller and a master entertainer.\n\nInside Out is every bit a Pixar fan&apos;s well-deserved reward for patience. Do yourself a favor and watch this magnificent gem.",

In fact, I would consider it to be my second favorite Hitchcock movie ever, my first being &quot;Psycho&quot; (although I haven&apos;t seen &quot;Rear window&quot; yet).\n\n  Margot (Grace Kelly) is married to Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player.  However, she has been seeing another man named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings).  Mark writes crime stories.  The two of them think that Tony doesn&apos;t know about their relationship but they&apos;re wrong; Tony has known about this relationship for one year and seems to have had enough of it.  So when Mark, who lives in New-York, comes to London to see Margot, Tony wants to go out with Mark and his wife.  But the night of the event, Tony is unable to go.  So he tells Margot to take Mark out and to have a good time.  The only problem is that Tony doesn&apos;t really have something that&apos;s keeping him from going out with Margot and Mark.  He has another plan, the plan being to blackmail one of his old college friends that has become a small time crook into murdering his wife.\n\n  What follows this is pure entertainment at its best.  As usual, Hitchcock masterfully directs this movie and has the right actors to do the job.  Ray Milland and Grace Kelly deliver very good performances and surprisingly enough, Robert Cummings does a rather good job in his role of Mark Halliday, the American crime novel writer who accidentally stumbles on the answer. But it is John Williams who steals the show with his great performance as Inspector Hubbard, the detective who holds the key to the whole mistery.  He is simply excellent and pretty funny when he is supposed to be.  Another of his great performances is in &quot;Witness for the prosecution&quot; where he played Brogan Moore, Charles Laughton&apos;s very good friend and seconding lawyer in the case.  As for &quot;Dial M for murder&quot;, well it&apos;s one of those movies that anyone should see at pretty much any cost.",

Taking into account that I was already expecting superior film, indeed, it came out to be even more outstanding than I thought, mainly because of the rare combination of noir genre with very precise and measured funny moments and especially an incredibly faithful description of the Argentine system of justice and the characters that compose it. This last element is just perfect. The movie keeps your attention all the time -no decays at all- and the set design is also great, to such extent that it left me wondering what the tricks of the trade employed to achieve such similarity are. Foreign watchers might not fully understand some great details that are mainly local, but anyway they will surely enjoy the thrilling aspects of the film. It would be enough for them to say that almost all this locale&apos;s are just true, no matter how incredible they might look.",

            "reviewBody": "I think this is possibly Miyazaki&apos;s most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.\n\nWhat I love about this movie is that it&apos;s highly emotional without a great deal of logic or plot or story to get in the way. In this way the film is simple, pure, and extremely beautiful. It is as if the characters go from one emotion to the next, in a world that is as random as one&apos;s own dreams. Some people have complained about the lack of plot or story or serious character development, but even though the characters are fairly static, their emotions and the physical changes they undergo as they go through these emotions brings out a higher truth that is seldom given such artistic and natural freedom.\n\nI think this is a very smart movie in many subtle ways and it&apos;s one that I look forward to watching again on the big screen and then on DVD. Although it flirts from theme to theme to theme with a kind of animated attention deficit disorder, the landscapes and utter unabated surrealism left me stunned and never bored.\n\nAlso, from a quizzical character design perspective, Howl is certainly one of if not the most beautiful characters that Miyazaki has ever created. Howl is an interesting departure from Miyazaki&apos;s more classical wabi-sabi anime style that most of his heroes and heroines are drawn in as Howl is definitely a very contemporary bishonen.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for quaint settings, dynamic characters and a very involving character or plot driven story, you&apos;re not going to necessarily find them here, but you will find an equally stunning and pleasing movie if you let yourself go and enjoy this passionate, heartfelt and surreal Miyazaki dream.",

            "reviewBody": "The Bridge on the River Kwai – David Lean&apos;s first epic, a genre he would later be associated with more than any other. Previously having made his mark as a director of deep and often psychological dramas, Lean&apos;s easy transition into bigger pictures reflects the change that was taking place in the genre itself, moving from the grandiose spectacle of De Mille et al, towards the &quot;intimate&quot; epic of the late 50s and early 60s.\n\nWe are also here seeing the development of the war, or rather, the anti-war picture. Prior to this most anti-war or anti-military pictures were small-scale dramas, whereas all the big war films were rousing flag wavers. Bridge on the River Kwai ticks both boxes, and is all the more effective for it. It is an anti-war film which prevents itself from becoming static or preachy, and an action film with a humanist edge.\n\nThe problem presented to David Lean, aside from the fact that he had never done anything on this scale before, is that Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman&apos;s multi-layered screenplay contains many different strands, with stories told from multiple points of view. Lean fortunately had dealt with such fragmentary narratives before – 1952&apos;s The Sound Barrier for example – and here he actually uses the trappings of the epic to keep the narrative focused. This was the first time he had used the cinemascope aspect ratio, but rather than employing it purely to show off the stunning landscapes (although he does do a fair bit of that too, and why not?) he also uses the width of the screen to cram varying elements into the frame. For example, in the scene where Nicholson (Alec Guinness) surveys the railway construction with his fellow officers, the figure of Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) can be seen on a hill in the background. This reminds us of his presence, and subtly keeps his story arc going.\n\nLean&apos;s use of colour is also remarkable. Of course, when your film is set in a PoW camp in the middle of a jungle, you have a fairly limited colour palette anyway, but Lean&apos;s crafty choice of camera angle and positioning is calculated to show off different tones at different times. In the opening moments, highly reminiscent of The African Queen (which, like Kwai, was produced by Sam Spiegel) he begins with the greens of the jungle – a fairly cold colour. As we descend through the trees, Lean gradually turns up the heat with those dusty yellows and browns. For the middle section of the film, he cools things off again with more lush greens and even some vibrant shades, before returning to the stark hot tones for the tense finale. Again, this is all very subtle director&apos;s work, but these touches do create little shifts in mood and influence the way we view each scene.\n\nLean&apos;s handling of the larger canvas was however not yet quite up to best showing off his actors upon it. That&apos;s a shame with such a good cast, although Alec Guinness in one of his earliest non-comedic roles shone through enough to garner an Oscar. William Holden was also deserving of at least a nomination, but didn&apos;t get one. To my mind though the best performance of the picture was that of Sessue Hayakawa. Hayakawa was an incredibly powerful silent film actor – check him out in De Mille&apos;s The Cheat (1915) – and it&apos;s great to see him at the top of his game again here.\n\nBombarded with awards, Bridge on the River Kwai is typical Oscar-winning fare, particularly for the conflicted political climate of the 1950s. It can be read as a damning critique of war, but also enjoyed as a gripping action film. This broad appeal, the depth of the screenplay and Lean&apos;s assured direction made it a hit in its day and allowed its popularity to endure in the generations since.",

            "reviewBody": "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark comedy that has an a-list cast with names like Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, John Hawkes, and Peter Dinklage. It centers around Mildred Hayes, a woman whose daughter was raped and killed, and who believes that the local police have not done enough about it. In reaction, she erects three billboards outside of her town that send a message to the sheriff about the state of the investigation.\n\nWriter/director Martin McDonagh (Seven Psychopaths, In Bruges) has outdone himself with this one. In my opinion, if this isn&apos;t one of the top Oscar contenders come awards season, then Hollywood has officially lost its mind.\n\nBasically everything about this film works: from the acting, to the writing, to the direction. Mcdormand gives the performance of her career here, giving us humor through all the pain clearly shown on her face. Rockwell also gives his best performance here as a cop who isn&apos;t that bright and is more than a little racist. \n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is probably the most unpredictable film of the year, and that&apos;s coming from a year that includes films like Baby Driver and Logan. There are scenes where you think that you know where the plot is going, but then midway through it completely flips the script. \n\nFor the entire run-time of this film, I was invested. It has the perfect run-time; it ends exactly when it needs to and there is not a scene that feels out of place. \n\nIt seems like one of the hardest things to do in film nowadays is to balance comedy and drama. However, this movie does it effortlessly. Each scene has just the right amount of comedy and drama, and sometimes, despite the fact that you&apos;re laughing, it&apos;s easy to forget that jokes are being made.\n\nAlso, the message that this film gives off resonates very powerfully with you after the film finishes. It makes you see the good side in humanity, despite our flaws. No character in this film is a cliché one-dimensional shell of a person. Everybody has a reason for being there, which is more than some films recently have offered.\n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best and most enjoyable films of 2017, and it will make you laugh, cry, and think all in one sitting. There are not any clear flaws with this film that I can find, but I am still searching.\n\nI give Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri an A+.",

And superstar status for Tom Hardy.\n\nWarrior, though a work of fiction, plays out like a true story; two brothers at odds with each other and their father, in the town of Pittsburgh, who resort to prize fighting, one for the money, the other to prove himself a man.",

Dark comic undertones and excellent character actor performances dominate this richly macabre crime story gone awry flick by the Coen brothers(Joel and Ethan) involving pathetic used car salesman Macy so hard up for money and respect (not necessarily in that order) that he hires a pair of dim-witted thugs to kidnap his wife for ransom from his father-in-law&apos;s vast wealth in a plot-line that unravels with nice little twists and snags.  McDormand (Best Actress) is perfect as a pregnant Midwestern sheriff on the case with a no-nonsense and homespun effect with her tactics of crime solving.  Great cinematography by Roger A. Deakins accentuates the bleak winterscape of unearthed uneasiness.  Nominated for Best Supporting Actor Macy, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Academy Award winner for Best Original Screenplay.",

            "reviewBody": "Hugh Jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family is put through during its darkest hour. This may be his best role to date. From the trailers you know that his character will be out for blood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feel his pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation. The director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative. This film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see for most viewers.",

Mei is falling asleep when Totoro shows up. Satsuki gives him an umbrella and he&apos;s overjoyed. He gives the girls a gift of acorns as he boards the cat-bus.\n\nIt&apos;s a gentle story with cute characters and an adorable spirit from legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki. The drama isn&apos;t that heightened but it&apos;s a great coming-of-age story nonetheless. Totoro discovering the fun of raindrops on the umbrella is pure joy. There is simply an endearing gentleness that extend even to the closing credits animation.",

Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant.\n\nI am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Frank but in this movie he is perfect. He gives a very fine performance. Tom Hanks is the FBI-agent Carl who is after him, and as always Hanks is good.\n\nThe story is inspired by a real story. I don&apos;t know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all I wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks. The scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great. If you want a nice funny movie, not too heavy, this one will definitely please you.",

CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, a film by Iranian filmmaker, Majid Majidi, takes us into the world of a little boy and his sister, letting us feel the love and trust that they have in each other. The boy, through no fault of his own, loses his little sister&apos;s newly repaired school shoes the day before she needs them. It becomes their secret. They try sharing a pair of his sneakers -- the girl wearing them in the morning and he in the afternoon to school. The wonderful, innocent faces of the beautiful Iranian children and their code of honor, even in poverty, provides the bases for a very uplifting tale of children trying to overcome a crisis. The direction, cinematography, music are all outstanding -- but it is the children that you will fall in love with. Well worth picking up on DVD (though there are no &quot;Extras&quot; to speak of).",

            "reviewBody": "I spent a weekend with the new DVD set of Blade Runner. Watched all four versions pretty much back to back (minus the work print version) starting with the US theatrical and finishing with the Final Cut. And across those eight hours I spent with the film, I did not get tired of watching – just watching – that futuristic film-noir vibe: deep dark shadows and majestic use of light and color used to make a run-down polluted cityscape look so beautiful. In fact, when I got to the Final Cut, which had been cleaned up, restored, and remixed, the picture and sound quite literally took my breath away.\n\nBlade Runner is easily one of the best looking films ever made.\n\nIn some ways, many ways, Blade Runner strikes me as silly. Particularly in its more climactic moments where the protagonist faces off against a replicant. Pris&apos;s acrobatic means of attacking Deckard? When Roy Batty chases Deckard in his shorts (when a few moments before he was fully clothed?) The film goes over-the-top to the point where I find myself asking, &quot;why in the world would the characters do that?!&quot; But here&apos;s what&apos;s interesting: as silly as Blade Runner may get it never betrays its own world. Everything that happens, in some queer way, feels natural to this strange futuristic world.\n\nI like the movie in its action scenes, but I simply adore it during the quieter moments – the parts where not a whole hell of a lot is happening, and you can simply watch and absorb Jordan Cronenweth&apos;s marvelous cinematography. My favorite scene comes when Rachel has saved Deckard&apos;s life. An emotional wreck of killing another replicant on top of the revelation that she, herself, is a replicant – she stands by a window where light floods in, so much light that the whole screen goes white, and then it recedes again and we see the characters again. Later in that same scene, she sits at the piano, plays for a bit, and then lets her hair down. Hearing Deckard stumbling in the other room, she looks out of the corner of her eye  and shot after shot after shot through this entire sequence demonstrates absolute mastery over the frame.\n\nPlus some of the other quiet moments resonate with a truer low-key science-fiction feel such as the scene in Tyrell corporation where Deckard applies the Voight-Kampff test to Rachel. More or less a mundane questionaire/interview with a typical sci-fi gadget sitting on the table, but Ridley Scott and Terry Rawlings compacts the lengthy endeavor into a few short moments using a stunningly simple montage.\n\nLater on, Deckard sits in front of a voice-activated screen analyzing a photograph. The task is presented as a dull monotonous job (made especially evident in Harrison Ford&apos;s delivery), yet the scene, itself, never bores. The voice-activation not only serves as a staple sci-fi device, but cleverly allows Deckard to take the audience&apos;s hand and guide them through this investigative process. And perhaps what I like most about the scene: the audience, and even Deckard himself, doesn&apos;t even really know what he&apos;s found. Things don&apos;t magically fall into place with a Scooby-Doo moment of revelation. He finds another clue that might lead somewhere (albeit, since it&apos;s a movie it&apos;s a good guess the clue does lead somewhere.) In my mind at least moments such as the Voight-Kampff scenes, Deckard&apos;s briefing, the photograph analysis, both of Rachel&apos;s scenes in Deckard&apos;s apartment gives the world of Blade Runner a solid grounding so later on it can get away with the absurd.\n\nWhich brings me to the replicants. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) in particular, whose strangely sympathetic in that his murderous tendencies spawn directly from his fear of dying. This is a man who possesses a strong conviction that he deserves life perhaps because he looks around on earth and sees people squandering their existence while he knows he only has a few short moments. Why should a shmuck like Deckard live for 50+ years when Roy in his 4 short years has seen attack ships burning off the shoulder of Orion and seen C-beams glitter in the dark  &quot;If only you could see what I&apos;ve seen with your eyes,&quot; he proudly and warmly tells one of the scientists who helped create him.\n\nAs for which cut of the film, I don&apos;t think any single one is perfect (and I&apos;d honestly watch any of them in a heartbeat.) I prefer the &quot;Final Cut&quot; over the others and admire Ridley Scott&apos;s restraint in his definitive DVD release. Most of the modifications are fine-tuning tweaks the casual viewer won&apos;t even notice unless watching two version back to back, and most of said fine-tuning improve the film (although, admittingly, Roy&apos;s beckoning of Sebastian could&apos;ve been left out.) But hell, all versions of Blade Runner are included, so people don&apos;t have much room to complain about the changes. And no matter what version you go with, it&apos;s still a beautiful film to just  watch.",

It&apos;s the kind of film that shows how much a master film-maker can communicate in a silent movie.  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion, but other than that it&apos;s a fine film.\n\nChaplin himself plays the &apos;Lone Prospector&apos;, and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama.  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors&apos; rickety cabins, plus some other good material.\n\nThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin re-edited in the 1940&apos;s, adding his own narration and deleting the title cards, which gives it a slightly different feel.  (These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who aren&apos;t used to silent films.) You can tell from Chaplin&apos;s narration how fond he must have been of &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;, and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it.  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless, but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art.",

            "reviewBody": "There&apos;s no question that Elia Kazan and Marlon Brando are at their very best in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;.  Kazan led a cast of solid talent in a morality play amidst the backdrop of the Depression-era New York waterfront.  Brando, much calmer than in his mercurial performance in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (also directed by Kazan), personifies the best in &quot;Method&quot; acting, perfectly engaging the viewer with his genuineness as Terry Malloy.\n\nIn the most famous scene, Brando, a has-been prizefighter, confronts his brother (Steiger) who is about to set him up to be executed by the mob bosses of the union.  When Steiger reveals his intent to set Brando up, the scene explodes with reality and pathos.  Brando&apos;s words, &quot;Wow&quot;, sum up the intensity and emotion of the scene.\n\nGreat acting and directing, however, cannot cover up the transparent political/apologetical intent of the movie.  Two years earlier, Kazan had sold out his integrity to the House Unamerican Affairs Committee (HUAC), &quot;naming names&quot; of those who would become the blacklisted Hollywood 10. Kazan, a former communist himself, regretted his involvement with the Party, and evidently decided it was politically advantageous to name his former associates.  Likewise, Brando character Malloy finds himself in a mob-run labor union, and in his effort to &apos;get out&apos;, repeats much of what Kazan did in real life.  Worse, Kazan, through the allegorical message of the film, brands his former writers as criminals and murders, and himself as the naive innocent.  Being a communist was no crime in the 30s, and he was no innocent.\n\n&quot;On the Waterfront&quot; is thus steeped in a right-wing political worldview. Mobs run labor unions.  Unions are thus corrupt organizations who exploit workers and make it harder for businesses to thrive.  Turn in union leaders into the police.  Even the church becomes a tool of the state to further the cause of the police against the union.\n\nBrando was never satisfied with &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;.  In fact, he later commented that it was indeed a tool for Kazan to justify his actions to the HUAC.  One thumb up for the acting, one thumb down for the cheap political message.",

I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna, introduced in the movie does not exist (you won&apos;t find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and it isn&apos;t possible to get to all the places in only one night, either (especially if you&apos;re a stranger and it&apos;s your first night in Vienna). But that&apos;s not the point. The relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Although, nothing ever really happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being &quot;Titanic&quot; or something. Even if you don&apos;t like love stories you should watch this film! I&apos;m a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.",

            "reviewBody": "A random and encounter has led Solomon Northup from living freely in New York to being kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana, getting handed over to various slave owners. There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.\n\nAs I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of &quot;Django Unchained&quot; and &quot;The Butler&quot;. But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen&apos;s &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot; shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.\n\nSteve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors&apos; faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn&apos;t just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer&apos;s poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.\n\nCentral to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.\n\nA fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender&apos;s portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.\n\nI was left speechless as the credits rolled. A lesser film would have added tacked-on sentimentality/exaggeration and politically influenced claptrap. Not this one. This is a movie to watch as a reminder of how powerful the human spirit can endeavor, and how lucky all of us have grown past that dreadful time in history. The full effect of it has not been felt in movies before, until now.",

They never really explained it easily or clearly. It&apos;s a difficult subject that the passing movie goers would best served by reading the books. Even with the books, some aspects could still be murky. The need for explanations requires some slower sections. The pacing still goes well. It does a passable job.

Even the late CH has become more a societal joke and less of an icon over time. Michael Moore made Heston&apos;s participation in the NRA a joke. (If Heston&apos;s concerns over where society is headed prove to be true, the final joke may be on Moore.) Back to the film. It is almost perfect. Then, as now. The script continually builds. Modern writers could learn from that. No matter what is presently on screen as you watch, the inevitability of the final climax beckons.\n\nThe acting is perfect.\n\nThe mixture of myth and drama is perfect.\n\nTrue the Roman dialog did not benefit from the verbal tricks that Stephen McKnight used in Spartacus (bending the script to match the flow of actual Roman) but it is more than enough to entertain and entrance.\n\nFrom the &quot;accident&quot; early in the film which starts the flow of events, to the chariot race WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN EQUALLED IN THE HISTORY OF FILM, to the reunion with lost family at the end, this is one of the most powerful and entertaining films of all time",

The main character, seventy-eight-year-old Professor Isak Borg is forced to see his life in a true and painful light, but he also would learn that there is hope.\n\nSparkling cinematography by Gunnar Fisher and superb acting of Bergman&apos;s regulars  Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Anderson, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Max von Sydow and especially, the great silent film director, Victor Sjostrom as Professor Borg add to many delights of &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; which also include Bergman&apos;s writing/directing with his famous mixing of conscious and unconscious, dreams and reality, the past and the present in the same scene.",

            "reviewBody": "Probably Buster Keaton&apos;s best film, and oddly enough, it&apos;s not even a straightforward comedy  it&apos;s actually an action film, with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure.  `The General&apos;, which is set during the Civil War, is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton, of course) who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army . . . and is turned down because the army feels he&apos;d be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier.  However, through a series of misunderstandings, both Johnny&apos;s family and his girl think he&apos;s a coward, and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier.  Months pass, and Johnny, sad and alone, is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North.  Johnny&apos;s efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girl&apos;s love  become an unbelievably funny and action-packed series of events, as Johnny tries to go from being a sad-sack buffoon to being a hero.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t watched many silent films, they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal&apos; film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression.  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive, as he&apos;s fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye.  While funny, Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well, and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well.  His timing, whether for a joke or for a tender moment, is absolutely impeccable.\n\nWhat&apos;s also great about `The General&apos; is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldn&apos;t be made today.  No amount of insurance would cover it.  Keaton does all his own stunts, and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General&apos; with a bike, he sits on a moving cattlecatcher, knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own.  All these stunts are fantastic, but it&apos;s scary to think that any one of these probably could&apos;ve killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong.  \n\n `The General&apos; is a lot more than slapstick.  Personally, I think it&apos;s one of the first films to push the envelope of movies  it goes for action, romance, and humor, and it pulls all of those elements together into a terrific movie. If you&apos;ve never seen Buster Keaton  or, for that matter, a silent film  go find this one and watch it.  It&apos;s a classic. A+",

I really had no idea what this film was about, having seen only one trailer which in the event, bore no relation to the plot whatsoever. However, my interest was piqued so this evening found me watching a splendid little film packed to the rafters with stars. This was the tale of Gustave H, the legendary and infamous Concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a rather glamorous edifice perched atop a mountain and his protégé and most trusted friend Zero, The Lobby Boy. This is a tale of friendship, murder, revenge and deep dark plotting. There were some completely ridiculous moments which were quite refreshing and several, what I like to call Guffaw moments where several members of the audience emit a loud blast of laughter followed by slightly hysterical giggling that you find yourself joining in with. As I said a host of stars in this film ranging from Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law and Bill Murray to Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson and Harvey Keitel to name a few, but one of the outstanding performances must go to Tony Revolori, a relatively unknown young actor who plays Zero, who is In almost every scene. An entertaining film, worth watching.",

            "reviewBody": "Three steel workers from a small town in Pennsylvania prepare to go to war in Vietnam.  The night before they go, Steven is married, sparking a large celebration.  The next morning they go deer hunting one last time in the woods before they leave.  Time passes and the three meet up again in Vietnam as prisoners of war. Brutal mental torture affects them in different ways before they escape and are separated again.  Back in Pennsylvania Michael realises the extent to which the war has not only affected him but devastated the lives of his friends in different ways.\n\nI have seen this film several times and I&apos;ll admit that I always assume that it is a classic film mainly because I saw it twice when I was in my early teens and was blown away by parts of it.  I say this because I want to acknowledge that it may not be as great a film as many critics lists believe it to be, but at the same time I still watch it occasionally as I find it to be a moving story and a good film.  The plot is moving if it is viewed on it&apos;s surface as a tale of three men whose lives are deeply affected by the war.  Going past that to deeper themes I always feel that the film doesn&apos;t manage to be as deep as it thinks it is, so I try not to linger too long on these.\n\nThe breakdown of the film gives significantly more time to events in the home town rather than Vietnam.  This is as it should be  for many people the war was a fleeting thing that has stayed with them for much longer than they were actually involved.  The wedding scene is a little overlong but it does serve as a chance to get to see the characters in their setting before we quickly move to the events that changed them and the people they become. The time in Vietnam is quite short but very memorable (many people who have never seen the film will still know these scenes) and the final hour or so of the film is moving even if it takes things to an extreme to make it&apos;s point.\n\nThe cast make the film work as well, if not more, than the material itself. De Niro is the rock on which it all stands and is pretty good.  The only weakness in his performance was that he was the one who had to be `the hero&apos; type who does what he can.  Walken gets the lion share of praise for his is the role that changes the most significantly throughout the film.  It is easy to forget that he was not anywhere near as famous as De Niro at this time and it is amazing in that regard to see him hold his own.  Savage gives a good performance and support is strong in the form of such actors as Cazale, Dzundza and Aspegren.  Even Streep gives a performance refreshingly free of sentiment or forced accents.\n\nThe film is a little overlong and could easily have lost 30 minutes (although not all from one place) to give it a tighter feel.  Some scenes feel stretched beyond their useful duration leading to the feel that the film wanted to be 3 hours long, rather than being cut back to 3 hours long. Despite this though I still think this is a good film that is a powerful story at it&apos;s heart. I personally don&apos;t think it would make my top 50 (were I ever to do one) but I will watch it again.",

            "reviewBody": "A film fully deserving to be in IMDb&apos;s top 250, Jim Sheridan&apos;s &quot;In The Name of the Father&quot; is an excellent piece of work. Based on a true and very touching story, the film recounts the story of Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis) who is wrongly accused as an IRA terrorist. Not only are the police bending the facts to prove their case, but in the process they also implicate members of his friends and family, including his father Giuseppe (Postlethwaithe) whose health condition is rather frail. Gerry is a rebellious and mildly delinquent boy who does not seem to have grown up, and his attitude toward his father is not the appropriate one; however, as they start to go through the ordeal together, Gerry gradually matures, and starts feeling a deep affection and respect for Giuseppe.\n\nThe story is heart-breaking and shocking at the same time, all the more so when one realizes that these things actually DID happen. Although there have been some minor modifications for the purpose of the film, the backbone of the story is left completely intact.\n\nThe two protagonists, Daniel Day-Liewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are delivering powerful performances, and they both deserved the Oscar hands-down. However, it would be unfair not to mention that virtually everyone in the film is great in his/her role.\n\nJim Sheridan&apos;s direction is also very good, giving the plot a fair and balanced perspective; although the film might initially appear as pro-Irish / anti-English, in fact I consider it as quite objective. Granted, it vividly shows that some key figures in the London police were profoundly biased and manipulated maliciously the case against the Conlons; yet, it also shows that English public attitudes turned highly supportive for the Conlons&apos; freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for the atrocities they had been charged with. We have always to remember that the film depicts a period of big tensions, with emotions running high to levels of hysteria, so we have to understand the events within this context.\n\nOf course, what happened to the Conlons is totally deplorable and unjustifiable; and it is real shame that the people who conspired against them have not been punished yet for their crimes. Still, one should understand the hostile attitude shown by those who were not part of this conspiracy (such as the judge, for example), who were influenced by the climate of terror and the outrage of the public. The Conlons had the terribly bad luck to be at the wrong place, in the wrong time, and with the wrong nationality; the also have the great misfortune to be captured by people who in their quest to show results were shamelessly willing to risk indicting people who could possibly be innocent.\n\n&quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; is a fantastic film, which one should not miss. 10/10.",

            "reviewBody": "Whoever it may be to rightly claim that he invented the action thriller genre (Méliès, I suppose), Henri-Georges Clouzot&apos;s &quot;Le salaire de la peur&quot; is an indispensable milestone on the exciting route to the best films of that kind in the 70&apos;s, 80&apos;s and nowadays. In its tenseness, as symbolized by the danger of explosion of the lorries&apos; loads, it has hardly been surpassed.\n\nThe plot is perfectly worked out from start to end, the leading players act in some of their best parts ever, the (almost) absence of music supports the brutal realism and the consequent choice of authentic outdoor settings contributed a lot to the film&apos;s deserved success. Historically, it ranges between neorealismo and nouvelle vague, and yet it is its pure action and suspense that make it worth watching for younger audiences who wouldn&apos;t go in for just the artistic way. - Only flaw I can see is the curious, rather artificial change in Vanel&apos;s character which has no comprehensible motivation, at least for me whenever I see it.\n\nApart from that, Clouzot&apos;s wife Véra (also well-known from his &quot;Les diaboliques&quot;) plays to the &quot;most breathtaking angles&quot; gallery when she bows down to scrub the floor of Dario Moreno&apos;s gin joint. It&apos;s a man&apos;s world after all and there are male perspectives on human survival only. Well, it&apos;s existentialism, mates. Altogether, the black and white photography is gripping. The gun scene between Lulli and Vanel is one of the best montages in film history, and there is more excellent editing in &quot;Salaire&quot; (including the finale) that completely fits the hot atmosphere.",

            "reviewBody": "Some movies - I wish there were more of them - simply look like a series of great paintings. This film has that look. You could freeze-frame many of the scenes and swear you were looking at a Gainsborough, a Vermeer, a Hogarth or similar work of art by one the great artists of three to five centuries ago. It&apos;s just beautiful.\n\nFor that, we have Director Stanley Kubrick and Photographer John Alcott to thank. Being a three-hour movie, there are plenty of wonderful shots to admire, too. In addition, the costumes are lavish and authentic and the scoring is notable. It&apos;s no accident that Oscars were garnered for art/set direction, cinematography, costume design and scoring. Yeah, if you enjoy classical music, you&apos;ll really enjoy the soundtrack, too, under the guidance of conductor Leonard Roseman.\n\nNot to be overlooked is the fine acting and the interesting and underrated story. I say &quot;underrated&quot; because this film, from what I&apos;ve read, bored a lot of people and and it was a box-office flop. That&apos;s too bad because, frankly, I found the story (outside of the first 10--15 minutes) to be fascinating. As I watched, I kept wondering what strange occurrences will happen next to the lead character, &quot;Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon,&quot; played beautifully by Ryan O&apos;Neal. (For most of the movie, he&apos;s called &quot;Redmond Barry,&quot; so I will refer to him as that.) \n\nOverall, this was a low-key adventure story about the rise-and-fall of a &quot;scoundrel&quot; back in late 18th century Englishman. &quot;Mr. Barry&quot; is an Irishmen living in England who winds up dealing with a number of people: Irish, English, Prussian, French. His dealings with these people are bizarre at times. While he mainly is shown doing what he can to promote himself, for either monetary gain and prestige of a name and power, he&apos;s not all bad. There is a compassionate side to him, but it only shows itself in small doses. It makes him all the more interesting to watch, because you don&apos;t always know how he&apos;s going to react to his circumstances, which change radically every few years.\n\nWe witness his rise to prominence and then his fall when his &quot;sins begin to find him out,&quot; as the Bible would describe. It&apos;s quite a roller coaster ride.\n\nThis is an emotional, involving story, and a feast for the eyes and ears. It&apos;s quite different, too, certainly not the average fare from Kubrick. I can only hope this comes out on a high-definition disc some day. Admirers of this film need to see this in all its glory.",

            "reviewBody": "When thinking about war films, it&apos;s very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.\n\nSome war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.\n\nDesmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss&apos; phenomenal story of courage saw him single-handedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.\n\nHacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.\n\nGibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. It&apos;s the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss&apos; arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.\n\nSpeaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you&apos;ll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and they&apos;re wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.\n\nComing to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider-Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider-Man films but it&apos;s great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.\n\nThe supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought I&apos;d see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.\n\nFew films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that&apos;s why I have to say it&apos;s a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. It&apos;s right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen.",

I have seen and own about 19 of his films/short films and this is the one that truly stands out.\n\nIt is rare these days to find a comedy which will make you laugh each and every time you see it. Yet this one, to me, seems not only to be able to do this but also to get BETTER the more you watch it.\n\nThe physical comedy, sight gags and insane stunts never cease to amaze me. That is what I love about Buster, the fact he did his own stunts shows that he was a great believer in producing a film that was genuine, that didnt try to trick or fool it&apos;s audience.\n\nI find it sad that today most people seem to think that comedy is about dialouge and punch lines, when it is clear from film master pieces such as Sherlock Jr. that this is not true. Silent movies are not to be ignored just because they are &apos;old&apos;, when I watch many of them they feel as fresh as any new comedy - if not more so.\n\nSo thank-you Buster!",

            "reviewBody": "The media and those in Washington, D.C. cringed in 1939 when Frank Capra (Oscar-nominated for directing) come out with &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;. Capra, fresh off amazing successes like &quot;Lady for a Day&quot;, &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;, &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; and &quot;You Can&apos;t Take It With You&quot;, used his power to slap some bigwigs in the face with a powerful medium---the motion picture. The result was an immediate backlash by publications and politicians, but cheers from critics and the audience. As with society, the critics and the masses won out as the movie is a masterpiece in every way. A U.S. Senate vacancy leads to a dilemma. Who should be put in office? Everyone believes the apparently naive and gullible James Stewart (Oscar-nominated) is the logical choice because he will be easy to manipulate and he won&apos;t rock the boat. Stewart, the leader of the Boy Rangers (a local camp association for youngsters), gets blind-sided by many high-ranking officials who have alterior motives (Oscar nominees Harry Carey and Claude Rains in particular) when his idea for a national boys&apos; camp goes by the wayside. Thus the only thing left for Stewart is to beat those in charge by beating them at their own game---creating a filibuster (a never-ending governmental argument for his cause). Stewart is solid as always here and the supporters (love interest/reporter Jean Arthur and drunk newspaper man Thomas Mitchell included with the aforementioned players) are all terrific throughout. The Oscar-winning screenplay is deceptively intelligent and Capra just had the uncanny ability to mix comedy, drama and interpersonal characterizations together to make consistently wonderful American film experiences. 5 stars out of 5.",

Memories of Murder isn&apos;t a fast-paced film, by any means, but this time the slow pace made this movie about an investigation of serial killings so much better than 95% of its American counterparts.\n\nEssentially, Memories of Murder is a drama first with thriller and comedy elements (yes, in the first hour or so the movie is actually quite funny). Kang-ho Song and Sang-kyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. The character development is fascinating and believable thanks to a great script.\n\nHighly recommended.",

            "reviewBody": "A compelling contemplation of death and the nature of Man&apos;s existence, Ingmar Bergman&apos;s `The Seventh Seal&apos; is uncompromising, riveting drama that is every bit as striking conceptually as it is philosophically.  In the Fourteenth Century a knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), and his squire, Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand), have returned after ten years away at the Crusades to their native Sweden, and are beginning their journey home.  For Block, it is a pensive time; he is troubled by what he perceives as God&apos;s silence, and thirsts for knowledge and some meaning to his life, as well as a resolution of faith, which has deserted him.  Jons, meanwhile, is a study in jaded indifference, who believes in nothing beyond the present and whatever his senses and current circumstances dictate.  Shortly after their arrival on the coast of Sweden, Death (Bengt Ekerot) comes for Block.  But Block strikes a bargain with him, challenging him to a game of chess, to be played as they continue on with their journey.  As long as Block prevails, they will go on; if he wins, he will be released.  And though Block knows what the outcome must inevitably be, he welcomes Death&apos;s acceptance of his challenge, for the game affords him perhaps enough time to fulfill his quest, while adding purpose to what promises to be an arduous trek through a land being ravaged by the Black Plague. \tVon Sydow brings a commanding presence to the screen as Block, his very countenance bespeaking strength and poise.  His subtle, stoic approach to this enigmatic character is captivating, and lends a depth and dignity that makes Block truly memorable.  By contrast, Jons&apos; strength seems born of his indifference; he takes things as they come, and is governed by a somewhat fatalistic philosophy.  Bjornstrand, a gifted, eloquent actor (and veteran of numerous Bergman films), invests an earthy, gritty quality to Jons that plays effectively opposite von Sydow&apos;s more ethereal portrayal of Block.  It is significant that in the closing scene the final speech, in the presence of Death, is accorded to Jons; for it elevates the character to a station equal to, if not surpassing, that of the protagonist, Block. \tThe supporting cast includes Nils Poppe (Jof), Bibi Andersson (Mia), Inga Gill (Lisa), Gunnel Lindblom (Girl), Anders Ek (The Monk), Ake Fridell (Plog) and Erik Strandmark (Skat).  Written and directed by Bergman, `The Seventh Seal&apos; is a thought provoking, earnest meditation on faith and mortality that is filled with stunning metaphoric and visual images that will forever be indelibly inscribed in your memory.  One scene in particular, in which the players link hands and, silhouetted against a twilight sky are led by Death in a dance across the crest of a distant hill, is breathtaking in it&apos;s simplicity.  It stands (as does this entire film) as an example of why Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest directors in the history of the cinema.  I rate this one 10/10.",

            "reviewBody": "I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie popping up. People complaining that there is a lack of story and character development, and too much action.... too much action? Really? Have these people never seen a Mad Max movie before? How is that a bad thing in a Mad Max movie? Fury Road feels like an 80&apos;s action movie, with a preposterously large budget, and it is GLORIOUS. This movie was an epic ride. So many awesome set pieces, incredible car designs, twisted and bizarre costumes and characters, and a lot of really strong warrior women as well.\n\nI&apos;ve also heard it said that this movie contains a lot of feminism. Strong female characters that kick butt, is not feminism people! There&apos;s no anti-men message here. Just a cast which is dominated by more women than men. And about time for a change! Charlize Theron is my new favorite actress after this (it used to be Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton). She really takes the spotlight, and that is about the only criticism I can think of with this movie. It&apos;s not so much about Mad Max, but about road warriors in general, and specifically Theron&apos;s character. I didn&apos;t think Tom Hardy was quite as good as Mad Max as Mel Gibson was, but he wasn&apos;t terrible. He just didn&apos;t lend enough presence to his character in this movie. Which may be a hard thing to do when the movie does not focus on Max.\n\nSpecial mention should also be given to all the side characters. The villains are enjoyably menacing, especially Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, John Howard as the People Eater, Richard Carter as the Bullet Farmer, and I also loved Melissa Jaffer as the leader of a gang of elderly motor ladies.\n\nGo see this movie if you like Mad Max!",

            "reviewBody": "That review summary may sound very oxymoronic, but to me it applies to a film such as &apos;Room&apos;. A film with a difficult subject, that is the stuff of nightmares, but tells it so beautifully with an interesting approach that works better than all the potential traps that films of its genre could fall under.\n\nWhat could have easily have been told in a lurid, gratuitous way (being inspired by the true-life case of Josef Fritzl) is instead told in a careful and restrained way. There is even an innocence in &apos;Room&apos;, due to its very fascinating decision to tell it from the viewpoint of a five year old, in this case Jack, one that comes off very movingly and gives a sense that there is a little ray of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. The source material, equally brilliant, is to be thanked here, its author Emily Donoghue adapts it to screen here and none of its power is lost. \n\nReally appreciated the careful and restrained approach to the storytelling in &apos;Room&apos;, and for me and many others it was something different considering the subject. It does though affect some of the pacing in the middle act, where a little of the tension seen in especially the first part is lost a little. \n\nFor my tastes too, though it probably did fit the film&apos;s younger and more innocent viewpoint it&apos;s told from, the music score does lay it on too thick with the treacle.\n\nHowever, loved how the story was told and its approach. What &apos;Room&apos; also strongly benefitted from being told this way was that the mother and son relationship was able to shine through and really resonate, which it may not have done as effectively with a heavier tone. And shine through it does, with great charm and poignancy. Also appreciated that none of the characters were painted too black and white, even Old Nick. \n\nProduction values are effectively claustrophobic and the nocturnal parts chillingly nightmarish. &apos;Room&apos; is beautifully directed by someone who understood how claustrophobic thrillers worked, how mother and son bonds do in dire situations do and the ability to combine both to ensure a powerful experience. A directing job that&apos;s both unsettling and empathetic. Similarly &apos;Room&apos; is written with effortless skill and deft thoughtfulness. \n\nCan&apos;t find anything to fault the performances. The superb one of Brie Larson, that was a very worthy Oscar (Golden Globe and Bafta too) win in her category, is an obvious starting point, but one mustn&apos;t overlook the beyond-his-years turn of young Jacob Tremblay, one of the best child acting performances in recent years, and William H Macy and Joan Allen both giving some of their best work in years. Sean Bridgers also gives much more to what could have been a standard cliché role.\n\nOverall, great powerful film but the somewhat fascinatingly unconventional (for the genre) way the story was told won&apos;t work for some. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "heading": "A Nutshell Review: How to Train Your Dragon",
            "reviewBody": "If this is done following the same old beat up formula that Hollywood sticks to with regards to animation, then the dragons will be yakking non-stop. Thank goodness that this film, directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, avoids this like the plague, and \n\nJay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a viking kid who happens to be more brains than brawn, more scrawny than buffed, and this of course sets him apart from the rest of his warrior clan folks, who are battle scarred from the constant defense of the village pests - dragons who come from afar to plunder their livestock and setting their houses on fire, so much so that every house on the block is relatively brand new. Wanting to help out in any way he can, he&apos;s deemed more of a liability than an asset, especially when even his dad Stoick (Gerard Butler) cannot appreciate his unique, technical talent.\n\nIn a stroke of uncanny luck, Hiccup downs a flying dragon in the heat of battle, and his compassion meant to set the dragon free, rather than trying to prove himself to be a worthy viking man by killing it. And it&apos;s a rare specimen of a dragon too, which would have brought him instant glory. So a bond between man and mythical beast gets struck, and christened as Toothless, this is one pest who slowly grows into a pet, with Hiccup&apos;s secret rendezvous resulting in growing appreciation for the species, despite what the knowledge that his kinsman had compiled into a Dragon compendium which details facts all ending with an advisory on compulsory annihilation.\n\nThe story here is the strength of the film, being witty, smart but never condescending nor insulting the intelligence of the audience. While most characters are caricatures, especially Hiccup&apos;s peers, a lot of effort have been put into creating the leads as multi-dimensional and full of heart, and I enjoyed how the characters are so open to their emotions, that it becomes a lot more real than the photo realistic 3D animation and effects. Sure there&apos;s the usual father-son misunderstanding and expectations, and how a zero turns to hero, or even the theme of fearing something that we don&apos;t fully comprehend, but it&apos;s the manner in which the usual got delivered, that made all the difference. Especially so for its anti-war stance, that all it takes is a little step back from the common battle-cry, and instead seek to be understood, by holding out an olive branch, and to understand first.\n\nFor those who enjoy the mythology of the dragon creature, there are a number of ideas thrown up in the film that would make you nod in appreciation how these got conjured up for the film, and they worked wonders, even though they may be a tad predictable plot wise. And I&apos;m betting that a lot of folks out there will take to Toothless, thanks to its &quot;stitch&quot;-ish design similar to Lilo and Stitch (since it&apos;s co-director Chris Sander&apos;s previous work) and huge saucer like eyes, plus a lovable demeanour built into the character that&apos;s always apprehensive, and mischievous. Being the creature that has no track record also helped, since it ropes you into a journey of friendship, bonding and discovery with Hiccup as to how powerful his new found friend can be, not to mention how symbiotic their relationship will evolve into as well.\n\nAction junkies will find the action sequences in the film faultless, and the 3D got specifically crafted for certain set action pieces that really had me ducking for cover, for once. Fights are incredible, and always accompanied either by humour that worked without the feeling that it was deliberate nor just tried too hard, coupled with the comedic voice talents such as Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon is similar to last year&apos;s Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs - Long titles, great story, beautiful animation and a total delight. Highly recommended, and it goes into my list as contenders for best films of this year!",

When you are ready to watch a movie you scratch one of the boxes off and it tells you what to watch. The first draw was Monsters, Inc. I haven&apos;t seen this classic for over 10 years, but my wife was pulling quotes out verbatim. The opening 10 minutes are executed to perfection. The characters are introduced nicely, the plot and obstacle to overcome laid out, the world built, and the comedic timing perfect. The compilation of Mike training Sully with scare exercises had me rolling. The movie does lose steam after this first 10 minutes but it certainly never sputters out. Monsters, Inc. is a classic for a reason, and is a must see.",

            "reviewBody": "How can anyone not dig The Dude? In a world where energetic go-getters are idolised and looked up to, it&apos;s nice to know that there are fat, indolent, scruffy, pot smoking, beer drinking bums out there taking it easy. Or they would be if people would leave their rugs alone \n\nThe Big Lebowski is a film where the plot is entirely inconsequential; it doesn&apos;t matter. It&apos;s just a mere device to set The Dude on his way. The joy is in watching him interact with all the weirdos in Los Angeles and in listening to the dialogue  the script is the most quotable since Withnail and I. Therefore it&apos;s the perfect film to just sit back and absorb.\n\nPicking a favourite scene in a film that is jam packed with great moments and wonderful lines of dialogue is a near impossibility, but you&apos;d be hard pressed to beat the scene with the Malibu police chief. &quot;I don&apos;t like your jerk-off name. I don&apos;t like your jerk-off face. I don&apos;t like your jerk-off behaviour. And I don&apos;t like youjerk-off.&quot; And then to cap it off he throws his mug at The Dude&apos;s head. Brilliant! And making it even funnier is the scene that immediately follows it where the taxi driver throws The Dude out of his cab.\n\nBut another favourite is Jesus. He only has two scenes but both are hilarious. (I hope the Coens make &apos;The Passion of the Jesus.&apos;) And I love the flashback where you see him knocking on doors to tell his neighbours that he&apos;s a pederast. Especially good is the way that a large, bearded man with a dirty shirt answers the door (I always crack up at the breath Jesus takes when he sees the man  I also noticed, for the first time, that Jesus in that flashback is visibly showing in his tight jeans; he&apos;s not a small guy).\n\nBut then there&apos;s the scene where The Dude first meets Maude Lebowski (excellently played by Julianne Moore). &quot;I&apos;m sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but&quot; And I also like the little dig at the porno film they&apos;re watching: &quot;The plot is ludicrous.&quot; But the comment isn&apos;t really aimed at the porno film; the film is talking about itself. It knows the plot is nonsensical but it also knows that it doesn&apos;t matter  it&apos;s best to just let it wash over you.\n\nMentioning porno has reminded me of Jackie Treehorn. Is there a better visual gag in modern cinema than The Dude scratching a notepad for a message or telephone number only to find a cartoon of a man with a gigantic erection? Well, maybe there is, because even earlier in the film there&apos;s the moment where The Dude spends a long time making a homemade device to keep intruders out only for him to forget the fact that his door opens outwards instead of inwards  he nails a bit of wood to the floor, props a chair up to the door handle to keep people out and the very second he walks away, the door opens and the chair comes tumbling down. Pure genius! \n\nAnd Jackie Treehorn&apos;s brainless goons are brilliant too. &quot;You&apos;re not dealing with morons here.&quot; Oh yes we are. But the film&apos;s all the better for it.\n\nBut I&apos;m not sure what my favourite line in the film would be  again it&apos;s almost impossible to pick just one. But &quot;I still jerk-off manually&quot; would have to be up there, as would virtually every line Walter spews (&quot;The Chinaman is not the issue&quot;). However, if I was forced (at gunpoint) to choose, I&apos;d have to go with a piece of Dude wisdom: &quot;Fortunately, I&apos;m adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regiment to keep my mind, you know, uh, limber.&quot; And The Dude&apos;s reaction when Maude tells him that she&apos;s trying to conceive is magnificent.\n\nYet another brilliant scene is the Larry scene. Walter and The Dude are trying to get information out of some kid but the kid just stares impassively at them, so Walter destroys his car  or what he thinks is his car. Now at this moment I could quote the real dialogue, but the TV version dialogue is perhaps even better. &quot;Do you see what happens, Larry? Do you see what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps?&quot; It&apos;s even better than: &quot;Fun you, melon farmer!&quot; \n\nThen there are the nihilists. &quot;We believe in nothing, Lebowski. Nothing. And tomorrow we come back and we cut off your johnson.&quot; But try as they might to intimidate, the only scary thing about the nihilists is the techno music they listen to. Well, that and their obsession with the male member.\n\nBut I could quote lines from The Big Lewbowski all day. I just dig the film so much because it puts a goofy grin on my face; its stupidity is remarkably intelligent. Plus, in the end, it&apos;s actually quite heartfelt  if the film&apos;s about anything, it&apos;s about friendshipwell, that and smoking pot, drinking beer, bowling and keeping hold of your johnson. Yeah, the world&apos;s a better place with The Dude in it.",

            "reviewBody": "Jaws (1975) **** (out of 4) \n\nSteven Spielberg&apos;s classic about a man-eating Great White shark stalking the beaches of Amity and the three men who go out to try and kill it. Seriously, is there anyone who doesn&apos;t know the plot to this masterpiece? \n\nConsidering all the production trouble on this thing it would be amazing to get a half-way decent film yet for some reason, perhaps the movie Gods were shining down, we ended up with one of the greatest films ever made. This is without question one of the greatest films to deal with tension as Spielberg masterfully handles all the material. The movie is like an amazing roller coaster as we get one scare after another until the end when we just get our senses attacked from all around. Millions of people have discussed the greatness of this film so it&apos;s hard to pick one thing but I&apos;d say the greatest achievement of the film is the simple adventure it gives us.\n\nEven though we get some very intense scenes the screenplay is smart enough to give us other things to go with. We got some nice black humor in the witty dialogue but we also get a good buddy picture with Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss delivering memorable characters. The three of them together are so different yet all three are like people I&apos;m sure each viewer has met so it&apos;s easy to connect with them and it makes the film all the more fun when we go on this adventure.\n\nThe film, of course, benefits from the brilliant John Williams score, which is perhaps the most memorable in film history. Bruce, the name given to the shark, caused most of the problems during filming but you wouldn&apos;t know that by just watching the picture. The look of the shark is incredible and Spielberg certainly made the right decision of keeping it hidden and just revealing bits and pieces as the movie went along. The first glimpse in the pond is hauntingly shocking and each sighting just grows more and more tension. The director also knows how to build suspense without us seeing the shark as we&apos;re constantly viewing objects floating (the dock, the barrels) to imply that the creature is there.\n\nWhat&apos;s even more amazing is that this film scared people so badly that they refused to go into the water yet the most suspenseful scene is probably the now legendary speech by Shaw about his time on the USS Indianapolis. It goes without saying but the three leads are all terrific in their roles and I really can&apos;t think of too many movies that have as many memorable characters as the ones here. We also get strong supporting work from Murray Hamilton as the Mayor and Lorraine Gary as Brody&apos;s wife.\n\nFor me this ranks as one of the greatest adventures ever captured on film because everyone involved makes it feel so real. When the men get on the boat to go after the shark you feel as if you&apos;re really there. When the camera is underwater given a POV shot of the shark, you feel as if you&apos;re in the water. The final death scene in the movie also just happens to be one of the most terrifying ever captured on film and it might even be the most brutal. The movie is a true masterpiece of suspense and I think it would be fair that nothing has come close to this in the past 35 years. Like PSYCHO, we&apos;ve had a lot of rips of imitations but nothing has come close to the same power and it&apos;s doubtful anything ever will.",

            "reviewBody": "Dead Poets Society is, to use a cliché, a cinematic masterpiece. I can watch it over and over, absorbing more nuances of meaning every time. As a former teacher myself (albeit of science), I view it as a tribute to the profession at its best...teaching not merely the subject but also the person, and having a lifelong impact on students&apos; lives.\n\nThe setting is Weldon Academy, a very traditional New England boys&apos; prep school in 1959. If I can find one flaw with the movie...and there certainly aren&apos;t many...it&apos;s the underlying premise that seems to worship free thought and implies that ALL tradition is of necessity undesirable and thus to be avoided. Frankly, compared to modern classrooms which are bastions of free expression, I found the Weldon students&apos; respectful treatment of their teachers rather refreshing. (But perhaps that&apos;s just the ex-teacher in me coming out!) Some of Weldon&apos;s ideals, generally referred to in mocking tones, are actually qualities to which parents rightfully DO hope their offspring will aspire.\n\nRobin Williams plays Mr. Keating, the English teacher we all wish we&apos;d had. He brings warmth, passion, and an endearing quiet humor to the role as he fosters individualism in a school environment of total conformity, endeavoring to teach these young men both the beauty of the English language and the importance of living life to the full, of &quot;seizing the day&quot;. How many of us mentally revolted at the dissection of poetry when we were in school? Many a viewer will both chortle and rejoice when Mr. Keating has his class rip out the methodical, emotionless &quot;Introduction to Poetry&quot; from the time honored Pritchard textbook! \n\nThe &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, and the boys on which Mr. Keating has such a profound impact, include an interesting mix of characters...Neil Perry (the passionate young man at odds with his father&apos;s clearly defined expectations for his son&apos;s life), Todd Anderson (the classic shy adolescent, through whose eyes we view the unfolding drama), Charlie Dalton (the quintessential rebel), Knox Overstreet (the teen with whom most viewers can identify, deep in the throes of first love), and Richard Cameron (the mindless conformist).\n\nEthan Hawke gives a moving performance as Todd, the younger brother of a former Weldon valedictorian and my personal favorite, who undergoes a character transformation as the plot unfolds. In a sense, this movie is really Todd&apos;s story. As another reviewer has wisely pointed out, his best scenes are sometimes when he has no dialogue at all. Your heart will ache for him. The sub-plot of young Overstreet&apos;s romance with a girl from a nearby school may not be brilliant, but it provides some light, entertaining relief from the main drama. \n\nNeedless to say, Mr. Keating&apos;s unorthodox approach meets with obstacles...from his fellow teachers, from the school&apos;s ultra traditional Headmaster, from Neil&apos;s overbearing father and the other parents, who are depicted as a conservative, status conscious lot. His encouragement of adolescent individualism leads to dramatic consequences for one student in particular, triggering a dramatic scenario that engulfs most of his classmates. I don&apos;t want to give the plot away, but Dead Poets Society has the most powerful ending I&apos;ve experienced in the cinematic world. I could watch it over and over, and tears would either come to my eyes or virtually stream down my cheeks every time.\n\nIt&apos;s an intelligent film, both gripping to watch and thought provoking afterward. Engaging plot, memorable characters, meaningful theme, wonderfully done scenes and atmosphere...Dead Poets Society has it all. A special tip of my hat to the cinematography; clearly, it should have won an Oscar for the final scene alone.\n\nThis is a must-see movie, especially if you&apos;re a high school student who hates English. It might just change your view of the subject, even if your actual teacher doesn&apos;t quite measure up to Mr. Keating. And for everyone...not only &quot;Carpe Diem&quot;, but a certain phrase from a Walt Whitman poem will take on incredible meaning and be remembered forever.",

But of course that&apos;s like saying Mona Lisa is just a picture of a woman, or The Last Supper is dudes eating. If you experience it with open mind, The Passion of Joan of Arc will give you one of the most profound visions of devotion, faith and martyrdom.\n\nI must confess, even I thought the praise of The Passion was too good to be true when I began to watch it. But when the film ended, I wasn&apos;t just impressed, I was completely devastated. The Passion of Joan of Arc is a downright amazing realization of Joan&apos;s last moments. There&apos;s not a hint of sentimentality, and still I was in tears. Yep. Call me a pansy, but this is one of the very few movies that had that impact on me.\n\nI don&apos;t know what else to say about this movie, sorry. The Passion of Joan of Arc counts as the most upsetting movie experience I&apos;ve ever had, but it&apos;s definitely a positive one. On the contrary to what the other commentators have said, you don&apos;t have to be religious to be receptive in front of this movie. Believe me, I&apos;m a hardcore atheist. If you&apos;re going to see this film -- I sure hope you do -- make sure it&apos;s accompanied with the Voices of Light soundtrack, which doesn&apos;t just fit the film well, but is amazing as a standalone composition, too. I can guarantee you won&apos;t look cinema the same way again.",

            "reviewBody": "A fantastic film that belies the simplicity of its plot, Tokyo Story is the tale of a vacation gone sadly awry, with an elderly man and woman visiting from the countryside pushed to the sidelines by their busy children in the city. The younger generation (and by extension the &quot;new&quot; Japan) turns its back on the family from which it arose- because of selfishness, because of necessity, or because it&apos;s simply the way of the world. The movie provides no easy answers- its melancholy ambiguity is part of its charm. Whatever the case, Ozu delights in portraying the details of everyday life. The emotional resonances of this movie are extraordinary, and some shots (a child picking flowers, an old couple framed by the sea, a woman sitting forlornly at her work desk) are enough to give a sensitive film-goer the shivers. Despite the testimony of some critics, the film is not totally devoid of melodramatic elements (some stock characters and cloying musical motifs spring readily to mind), but the film is founded upon such an obvious love and respect for the importance of real-world interactions that it&apos;s hard not to be anything other than enthralled by it.",

Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is a Hutu happily married (Sophie Okonedo) and with children .He&apos;s a Hotel manager -Millie Collines proprietary of Belgian Airlines : Sabena- and its General Director(Jean Reno) placed in Belgium. Paul is respected for his generosity , charm , friendship and numerous contacts with important people. He&apos;s accidentally trapped in violent events when his family and neighbours are threatened to be killed . He gets avoid it by means of bribes with the hope that United Nations (UN) and international forces arrive to preventing the civil war. However the happenings break out again . After assassination President of Rwanda, all get worse. It begins the horrible genocide including rampage , massacres and ravage in Rwanda which is spread along Burundi. Slaughter of Tusis by the Hutu is executed by soldiers and rebels. A journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) get into tumult and will shoot the events to show it all around the world. Paul gets to protect his family and unfortunate refugees at the hotel but others hapless people by the hundred are coming to ask for help. Meanwhile, the refugees Tutsis flee toward Congo to find shelter .The film has an acid critic to the indolence of United Nations (exception for Colonel incarnated by Nick Nolte) and international community and specially , the abandon of the European foreign policy .\n\nAn interesting and thought-provoking film depicting terrible happenings and based on historical facts . Thus, a character tells that origin conflict is due to Belgians whom in colonization time differentiated the Tutsi as highest and more white complexion and co-governed united the country, now the Hutu are taking the vengeance. It&apos;s calculated in the indiscriminate massacre were cruelly killed by militia Interhamwe approximately one million people and in only three month. The bloody conflict finished in 1994 when the Tutsi throw out the Hutu army and militia through the frontier Congo. Leader of Interhamwe was condemned to maxim penalty. Don Cheadle&apos;s interpretation is magnificent , he was nominated to Academy Award , although wrongly didn&apos;t obtain it . The motion picture well directed by Terry George. Rating : Awesome and above average . Indispensable and essential watching.",

I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing.. A very whole package overall.\n\nTo finish off; I am STILL not interested in cars or racing, but this film stands on its own even so.",

            "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t remember exactly when I first saw this film, but for a long time I thought that the second of the series was my favorite.  Well, I recently bought the DVD box-set and after I watched the first movie again I knew that it was definitely the best in the series, and also one of the best movies ever made.  Rocky is very much more than just a boxing movie.  It&apos;s a movie about the unbreakable human spirit, determination, and the will to &quot;go the distance.&quot;  Rocky(Sylvester Stallone) is a second rate club-fighter and a debt collector for a loan shark(Joe Spinnell).  He becomes involved with a shy girl working in a petshop named Adrian(Talia Shire), and also becomes friends with her brother Paulie(Burt Young).  Rocky&apos;s life really isn&apos;t anything of interest - until the World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) gives him an unexpected shot at the title.  An old boxer-turned-trainer named Mick(Burgess Meredith) offers to be Rocky&apos;s manager.  Although the whole film is outstanding, what follows are some of the greatest and most memorable movie moments of all time.  Rocky striving to go the distance in the training scene, the final fight, and the closing moments of the film are so emotional and inspiring that they perfectly demonstrate the human spirit and can bring out the will to win in anybody. Add to this an excellent music score and you have  a classic and unforgettable movie.  Without a doubt deserved the Best Picture award in 1976.   Exceptional performances by all the cast members, notably Burgess Meredith and Sylvester Stallone.  **** out of ****",

            "reviewBody": "Ever since Steven Spielberg wowed the cinematic world and changed the aesthetic of the war movie forever with the exceptional opening 25 minutes of 1998&apos;s Saving Private Ryan - the film went downhill from there - audiences have come to expect the same grainy camera-work and ultra-realism of Spielberg&apos;s breathtaking vision whenever a battle is depicted. Anything else would be &apos;unrealistic&apos;, and many movies dated horribly almost overnight as a result. While Oliver Stone&apos;s Platoon, which was once considered difficult to watch due to its unflinching depiction of the insanity of war, may not seem quite as brutal as it used to, it possesses one thing that no war other movie can boast - the guiding hand of a veteran.\n\nStone did a tour in Vietnam which ended in 1968, changing the future writer/director forever. Starting out life as a screenplay focusing on a soldier&apos;s experiences both before and during the war which had Jim Morrison touted for the lead, it evolved into a movie focused solely on a young volunteer&apos;s time spent in the sweaty, eternally damp jungle. Charlie Sheen&apos;s Chris Taylor is an obvious stand-in for Stone, and he arrives fresh-faced and eager to fight for his country. By the end, he is dazed and confused, and angry at the country who would send such &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot; men - invisible in society - into a world of such horror and meaningless bloodshed. It&apos;s an experience that moulded Stone into the one of the most outspoken voices in cinema.\n\nThe casting of the two sergeants vying for Chris&apos; soul is a stroke of genius. The platoon is made up of two main groups - the &apos;juicers&apos;, a collection of beer-swilling meat-heads seemingly intent on violence at every opportunity, and the &apos;heads&apos;, a more laid-back and weary bunch who are happiest when getting high and having a singalong. At the head of the juicers is Sgt. Barnes, played by Tom Berenger, an actor known for his heart-throb leading-man roles but here cast as a dead-eyed, heavily scarred brute. While Willem Dafoe, who was and still is known for his crazy-eyed villainous roles, plays the wiser, gentler leader of the heads, an all-round good guy battling his own demons. By toying with expectations, Stone adds layers to their characters, and they both received Best Actor nominations for their efforts.\n\nYet what makes Platoon truly stand out 30 years after its release is the way Stone manages to transport the audience to that terrible place. It&apos;s teeming with dangers at every turn, be it the ants, the snakes or the Viet Cong better equipped for the harsh surroundings, the most frightening moment is when they fall asleep. And even when they awake, there&apos;s something moving in the shadows. The film never allows you to ever be at ease, despite the fun to be had with spotting the many famous faces dotted throughout the supporting cast. There are flaws, especially with some overacting from some of the supporting cast - in particular John C. McGinley - and Chris&apos; unnecessary, rambling narration, but the movie packs such a punch that it&apos;s easy to forget these quibbles. It&apos;s a true insight into the mind of a grunt and how combat can have a lasting, eye-opening effect on those on the ground, and undoubtedly one of the most important war pictures ever to come out of the US.",

            "reviewBody": "Before you consider watching &quot;Spotlight&quot;, I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn&apos;t because I think it&apos;s a bad film--it&apos;s amazingly good. But it&apos;s also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers).\n\nThe story is about not only the discovery of a huge number of pedophile priests in the Boston parish by Boston Globe reporters but the organization&apos;s discovery that the problem went all the way to the top. In other words, even the beloved Cardinal Bernard Law KNEW about the many, many victims and yet did nothing to discipline them or restrict their access to more victims. But the film doesn&apos;t just talk about so much that we know to be true today but it covers the stop by step process by which the paper began and completed the investigation.\n\nWhy did I give the film a 10...particularly since I almost never give films such high scores? Well, the reason is that the folks making the movie really, really cared about the subject matter and getting it right. Instead of focusing on making money with the film and including the usual glitz and glamour, the filmmakers chose instead to emphasize realism above all else. Normal looking actors (such as Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo) are used...and they make efforts to keep them normal looking. Additionally, the film has a relatively slow and deliberate pace--again as they weren&apos;t interested in making a pretty or Hollywoodizing the production. Overall, a great film made greater because the folks making it really, really seemed to care and wanted to get it right...which showed great sensitivity for the subject matter and the victims. Great film!",

            "reviewBody": "Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you&apos;re a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there&apos;s that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.\n\nStand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They&apos;ve obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid&apos;s body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, it&apos;s a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, it&apos;s the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.\n\nThese are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and can&apos;t get any love or respect from his father and it&apos;s obvious that he gets it from his friends. That&apos;s what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy&apos;s best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, he&apos;s the kid who you knew in school and just knew he&apos;d turn out bad, but there&apos;s a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who&apos;s been disappointed so many times by an adult.\n\nTeddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there&apos;s Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other&apos;s appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.\n\nThe acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That&apos;s what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.\n\n10/10",

            "reviewBody": "As Asif Kapadia&apos;s gripping and extremely moving 2010 documentary Senna  proved, cinema audiences have a thirst for the larger-than-life  characters that inhabit the Formula One track. The sport itself is  frightfully dull (although I&apos;m sure plenty will disagree with that),  but the sportsmen willing to lay down their life for a kick and a  trophy are infinitely more fascinating, especially in the days of lax  safety rules. The sport nowadays is little more than advertising on  wheels, but when the likes of James Hunt and Niki Lauda battled it out  on the track, epic rivalries were created, and no matter how talented  these men were at driving these &quot;coffins on wheels&quot;, every race could  spell out death.  Rush portrays the clash of two opposing personalities. The long-haired,  dashing Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was all about the  adrenaline, embracing the post-race parties and lying with the many  women that would throw themselves at him. He was reckless, willing to  risk his life and others in order to win, but, as described in the  film, there was no better driver in the world in terms of raw talent.  His rival, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), was focused, clinical,  and even helped design the cars he would drive. He was the early-night  type, &apos;rat-faced&apos; and cold. In every sense, he&apos;s the perfect villain.  But where Rush succeeds the most is challenging our early conceptions  of these two characters. There&apos;s little fun to be had with Lauda, but  played by Bruhl, he evolves into the underdog of the movie, perhaps the  only one that actually gives a damn about his own life and the life of  his opponents. This, naturally, leads to tragedy and a particularly  wince-inducing scene in which Lauda requires having his lungs vacuumed,  but it&apos;s at this point that we realise just what these two drivers mean  to each other. As Lauda watches Hunt claw back some points in the 1976  Formula One season, it becomes clear that these two need each other to  survive. Their hatred of one another only serves to fuel the flames,  and leads to Lauda&apos;s defiant early return to the driver&apos;s seat, scarred  and bandaged.  Fast cars, beautiful women and exotic locations hardly sounds like a  recognisable workload for Ron Howard, one of the most play-it-easy  directors out there. His past films have been unjustifiably successful,  critically and commercially, never stamping a recognisable directorial  trait onto his work. Yet here, although the bright sheen of the 70&apos;s  initially takes some getting used to, he has managed to create a world  that is very much alive, using snappy editing, a pumping soundtrack and  some growing sound design to re-create this world for petrol-heads. But  he doesn&apos;t neglect his characters, and evokes the great work done on  Frost/Nixon (2008), which was also a study of two giant, clashing  personalities coming together on the world stage.  Rush is an exhilarating experience, able to distinguish each race from  the next and literally putting us in the driver&apos;s seat with the use of  digital cameras. Although it occasionally drifts into formulaic  territory with the introduction of the &apos;wives&apos; (played by Oivia Wilde  and Alexandra Maria Lara, respectively), Howard cleverly uses this as  an insight into Hunt and Lauda&apos;s personalities. Hemsworth is very good  in his first &apos;proper&apos; post-Thor role, but it is Bruhl that you take  away from the film. How he gets you to initially loath him, only to be  cheering him on at the climax is the work of a great actor, and it&apos;s a  crime that he has been snubbed by the Academy this year. Hopefully this  will inspire a host of decent sports movies, as Rush proves that you  can mix character study and even existential musings with the thrill of  sport.",

            "reviewBody": "To think that this blackest of black comedies was made in 1976 could only means two things: 1) Nothing has changed or 2) Paddy Chayefsky was seeing the future with the most disturbing clarity. I endorse the later of the two because I believe things have changed since 1974 - I wasn&apos;t born yet, but I know because of my parents, the movies, literature, etc, etc, etc. Peter Finch as the mad prophet of the airwaves gives Chayefsky a riveting and powerful voice. The scenes between old chums Finch and William Holden are some of the best written scenes in any American movie until the Coen brothers emerged. Finch is superb, superb! and Holden, at the end of a legendary career, gives a performance of such ferocious sincerity that I rediscovered the man, the actor and felt the need to revisit some of his opus. From Golden Boy to Sunset Boulevard, Holden was a man who carried his own discomfort as a weapon. Extraordinary! However, the most alarming character in the whole thing is Faye Dunaway&apos;s. She is magnificent in her thin, nervous, bra-less attitude. She is a monster of commercial amorality. Everything in this incredible movie moves with the precision of an inspired clairvoyant&apos;s vision. Duvall&apos;s executive, Beatrice Straight&apos;s betrayed wife and Ned Beatty&apos;s god like big shot makes this one of the most frightening, entertaining, funniest, remarkable film from the 70&apos;s. Sidney Lumet proves once more that he&apos;s as good as his material. Here he is at his zenith.",

            "reviewBody": "It is a little known fact that India produces more films per year than any other country. The reason that most people don&apos;t know that is because their films do not generally appeal to us, and we would see them as oddities suspended in their own culture. Possibly they&apos;d be amusing or interesting to watch, but they would probably be hard to enjoy (to demonstrate the difference in taste, Roger Ebert attended an Indian film festival a year or two ago, and when he questioned its director what American film did the best business over there, he answered that the movie _Baby&apos;s Day Out_, which is basically like one of those Popeye cartoons where Sweet-Pea wanders through construction sights blindly, except extended to 90 minutes, had theaters packed in India all throughout its run; the film bombed completely in the US). Tastes differ. Humanity does not. This is proved to the utmost in Ray&apos;s masterful _Pather Panchali_. \n\nThis film has got to be the best ever made about, well, life in general. It reminded me a lot of a Chinese film, Zhang Yimou&apos;s _To Live_, which was good, but its situations finally seemed a bit contrived. _Pather Panchali_ feels as real as life itself. To be sure, it contains great moments of sadness, but, for the most part, it concentrates on the beauty of the world around us. One of the major characters is this ancient woman, maybe even in her nineties. She is hunched over, has no teeth, and has crooked eyes. But Ray makes her form beautiful. He often finds characters with exaggerated and odd features. And there is nothing more beautiful in this world than the love between members of a family, and Ray revels in this. The relationship between the brother and sister is heartstoppingly beautiful.\n\n I could not say anything bad about this film. But there is one thing I would like to see: a DVD version of this film, and indeed of each of the films of the Apu Trilogy, and only Criterion could do this effectively, which is kind of disappointing, since I know a major film company already owns its rights and would probably never give them up without huge pay; a DVD version with scholarly commentary. Hindu symbology is present in a large quantity in this film, along with several Hindi ceremonies. Of course, I loved seeing this. I am not completely unfamiliar with the culture, so I was able to catch a little, but there is so much I don&apos;t know. A commentary track on a DVD would help me understand the film better, and thus love it even more.",

            "reviewBody": "Dorothy is a young girl living on a Kansas farm, during a tornado, she, along with her dog Toto, is swept up and plonked down in a magical and mysterious land known as Oz. Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch, she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way, she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard. It&apos;s a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.\n\nThe Wizard Of Oz is a film that has been pored over and dissected from almost everyone involved in the wonderful world of film. One thing that strikes me every time I view it is that there not only is no place like home, there is also no film like The Wizard Of Oz, and really, when all is said and done, there is unlikely to be another film of its ilk to ever grace the silver screen. Upon multiple viewings only the most biased of film fan could say that it is a technically perfect picture, it clearly isn&apos;t, for at times it&apos;s a wee bit creaky and when scrutinised, some of the performances in the piece are far from being of an excellent standard. Crucially, though, any misgivings are quickly erased due to the utter wonder of it all, you see this is because the film has a beguiling ability to transport everybody who is watching it and slot them into OZ alongside Dorothy.\n\nThe Wizard Of Oz appeals (and caters) to every demographic and pretty much any age group, we have adventure, the meeting of new friends, fears and trepidations, booming colour, songs to singalong with, and of course the total crux point of homely values. The Wizard Of Oz stands up well 80 years later because it taps into all the emotions available to the human being. Be it a young child spellbound on a first viewing, or an octogenarian couple of grandparents wistfully humming along to the tunes, it&apos;s a film that shouldn&apos;t be dissected looking for faults and hidden meanings, it&apos;s a film that should be loved and praised for the ode to fantastical whimsy that it so obviously is.\n\nThe film of course will forever be associated with its darling star, Judy Garland. Viewing now, and knowing what a sad life she would eventually lead, The Wizard Of Oz is a fitting picture on which to remember what a magical and wonderful performer she was. Myself as a lump of waning middle aged machismo, has no shame in saying that as Judy sings Somewhere Over The Rainbow I melt and feel as though I&apos;m being sent spinning into another world, that&apos;s the power of the piece, because as a sepia Kansas becomes the glorious colour of Oz, nothing else in my world matters, I&apos;m in hook line and sinker.\n\nThere are many interesting back stories to the picture, with books galore available to anyone interested. Some notes that might interest you being the original castings to be W.C. Fields, Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, munchkins running riot, drunken cast members, sadness and suicides, and grizzled old pros fighting hard not to let Garland steal the picture. Well it makes for a great read, for sure, but what remains to this day is one of the most beloved pictures to have ever been made, for once in the pantheon of great cinema we have a film that is termed a classic, that actually deserves to have that tag!\n\nOne of the great things about the advent of technology is that it can benefit old classic movies to make them better, for now we can view remastered editions of The Wizard Of Oz and appreciate even more what a great job the makers did. Keep your eyes on Dorothy&apos;s Ruby Slippers during the film and see how they are the sparkling important character that they should be, or take in the brilliant work of the make up crew, the tiniest of rivets on The Tin Man a testament to the brilliant work that goes into bringing magic to our lives. Get the newest copy you can and then also see it on the biggest screen available to you because The Wizard Of Oz is a 10/10 movie. And then some.",

For all of you in the same position, fear not ; Linklater, Hawke and Delphy (for it has surely been a joint effort and labour of love for all three) have done us and themselves proud. I&apos;ve just seen the film and despite being male and 38 I feel like Roberta Flack must have felt when she penned &apos;Killing me Softly&apos; after hearing Don McLean sing &apos;Vincent&apos; in concert; this is - once again - just so close to what it&apos;s all about. You want technicalities? The acting, superb; Hawke and Delphy slip right back into their characters, their mannerisms, their sometimes gauche repartee, the way they seem to fence around each other, seeming to go in for the kill then feigning, drawing backExquisite. And then the details, the echoes of the first film in the settings but now with a world-weariness, an autumnal note and yet with still that fundamental freshness and optimism that revives the memories of Sunrise&apos;s youthfulness and reminds us, as our heroes discuss, that though time changes people, there remains an unchanging core. Just see it; this is about as good as it gets, folks.",

            "reviewBody": "Bill Murray can be a very funny guy, especially when given roles where his character has a deliciously cruel edge. He has one of those faces, and a voice to go with it, which can make nastiness and sarcasm funny. Groundhog Day is a highly enjoyable vehicle for Murray&apos;s talents. It also has a very clever concept, neatly brought to the screen by actor-turned-director Harold Ramis (who starred alongside Murray in the Ghostbusters films).\n\nPittsburgh weather-man Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent on assignment to Punxatawney, where on Groundhog Day each year the locals have a tradition of consulting the groundhog to find out if spring is imminent or if they should prepare for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil despises the job and the town, and can&apos;t wait to get it over with.... even though he has a soft spot for Rita (Andie MacDowell), the producer overseeing his broadcast. Phil&apos;s dislike of Punxatawney, its people and its traditions is set to get a hell of a lot worse though.... as when he awakens the next morning he finds himself reliving the same day. And so it goes - every time Phil gets up, it&apos;s still February 2nd and he seems destined to be stuck in the same day for the rest of eternity.\n\nIt seems early on in the proceedings that the film might run out of steam and inspiration. After all, how can a film about a day which repeats itself be anything but repetitive? Thankfully, Groundhog Day is full of ingenious ideas, and it successfully throws up new developments and delightful twists at every opportunity. The film is laced with memorable dialogue, and Murray gets to play one of the defining roles of his career as a facetious, sharp-tongued misanthrope who ultimately learns the error of his ways. Groundhog Day is a very good film indeed, and restores one&apos;s faith in the imagination still lurking beneath the dismayingly shallow surface of Hollywood.",

            "reviewBody": "Three WWII veterans return home to small-town America to discover that they and their families have been irreparably changed.\n\nSuch a powerful film. At first the new lives of the soldiers seem to be facing small adjustments, such as their children&apos;s interest in &quot;atomic energy&quot; and &quot;scientific efficiency&quot;. But soon we find that jobs are hard to find, and the wives and girlfriends sometimes met new people while the battles were fought.\n\nAlthough a serious topic, the film has the right balance of entertainment and drama. It never gets outright depressing, and things like depression and suicide are overlooked. But it still remains a valuable lesson: as bad as dying in the war is, sometimes the transition back to normalcy can be just as damaging.\n\nAlthough not one of the better known movies today (2014), &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; won seven Academy Awards in 1946, including Best Picture, Best Director (William Wyler), Best Actor (Fredric March), Best Supporting Actor (Harold Russell), Best Film Editing (Daniel Mandell), Best Adapted Screenplay (Robert Sherwood), and Best Original Score (Hugo Friedhofer). It still sits on the IMDb Top 250, just as it should.",

            "reviewBody": "The Exorcist is one of the best movies to come out of the 70&apos;s and deserves better than slowly descending down the top 250. It&apos;s one of those essential films you have to see in order to understand what a movie truly is and this is more than a horror film. Unfortunately there are so many people who are saying they got bored, I think because they expected a terrifying movie, people! This isn&apos;t a slasher movie, this isn&apos;t some scary Michael Myers that you can shoot, this is a story about normal people in a normal house and upstairs there is a little girl who happens to be possessed by &quot;The devil himself&quot;. Faith is so strong and when it&apos;s shaken, anything in your imagination can run wild.\n\nFirst off the actors: Ellen Burstyn plays Chris McNeil, an actress working in Washington, D.C. on a film. She is the mother of Regan, the little girl who is possessed. I felt such sorrow for Chris, when she begs Father Karras to help her with Regan, I almost cried for her. Her daughter is not sick, this is nothing she can give Regan a pill and she&apos;ll be better. Her speech to Father Karras later on in the film: &quot;You show me Regan&apos;s double, same face, same voice, everything. And I&apos;d know it wasn&apos;t Regan. I&apos;d know in my gut. Now, I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there&apos;s nothing wrong with my daughter, except in her mind. You tell me for a fact that an exorcism wouldn&apos;t do any good! You tell me that!&quot; sent shivers down my spine, this woman knows what Regan needs and will do whatever she can.\n\nWe have Linda Blair who plays Regan and she was so great for a 12 year old actress. This little apple faced girl became one of the most frightening images of the 70&apos;s and still to this day. She&apos;s not scary because she&apos;s swearing, this little innocent girl has been taken over by forces that she shouldn&apos;t even know about. Jason Miller as Father Karras, for a man who had never acted professionally before, he was quite amazing as a priest who just lost his mother and his faith has been shaken up. Max Von Sydow as Father Merrin was so strong and he was like in his 20&apos;s playing a man in his 90&apos;s. He was robbed of an Oscar, he was so believable and just amazing during the exorcism scene.\n\nThe effects? People! This was the 70&apos;s and they made a bed float! They turned this little angel&apos;s face into a hideous creature! If you watch the documentary &quot;Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist&quot;, Ellen Burstyn gets slapped by Regan in the film and she had kind of a rope tied around her waist. When the stunt man pulled her back, Billy the director told the guy to let her have it and he YANKED her back hard causing real pain in Ellen&apos;s back and that was an actual scream in the movie. They froze the room to the point as were moisture got into the set and there was a layer of snow in the morning they were shooting. There was no CGI, this was the real deal and I believe could truly help the actors. Linda Blair was being thrashed up and down during one of the possessed scenes where the bracing came loose and caused slamming of metal to her back repeatedly and her screams were also very real and bone chilling.\n\nWilliam Freidkin is the director of The Exorcist, and there was no better choice. This guy took this picture seriously, so far as to shoot a gun offstage or scream obscenities to get an actor&apos;s shocked reaction on film. He slapped almost punched Reverend William O&apos;Malley who played Father Dyer to get him to shake during his reciting the Last Rites to Father Karras. He almost would have killed to make this picture and anyone doing it.\n\nWeither or not the set of The Exorcist was truly cursed with a total of 9 deaths linked to the film, a fire on the set with no apparent reason, and the total feeling of evil around the room, we&apos;ll never know. But The Exorcist is a true motion picture never to missed or deserve no more than the true compliments it should get! This is the film that should be shown to any aspiring film makers. It&apos;s a masterpiece of a film that&apos;s more than a mere horror flick.\n\n10/10",

            "reviewBody": "Joseph Tura and his wife are part of an actors troop in pre-WW2 Poland. When a handsome young pilot is forced to break off his affair with Mrs Tura to go to England and join the RAF, he sends a message through an English agent who offers to take messages to families of all the pilots when he goes to Poland.  Realising too late that Professor Siletsky is a double agent taking addresses to the Nazi&apos;s, Lt Sobinski alerts Tura who is forced to play several roles to try and outwit the Nazi&apos;s and protect the underground resistance.\n\nDespite having heard it mentioned (and avoided the remake) I had still never seen this film until earlier today.  I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect as I knew that it had been made during the war and that it&apos;s humour might not seem as mocking or sharp today.  However I was surprised how funny it actually was while it also dealt with the Nazi issue at the same time.  The mocking tone of the film is balanced nicely by a real vein of wit with sharp word play all around.  The plot is kept ticking over by this humour until Tura is able to drive the film by his many performances!\n\nThe Nazi&apos;s are mocked without taking away from the horrors of what they were.  The cast are what really makes the film work for me though.  Although he takes second billing, I can&apos;t help but feel that Benny is the star of the film as he has all the best characters and the lion&apos;s share of the lines. Lombard does very well indeed and shows a real ability for quick witty lines  the fact that she died in a plane crash leaving this her last movie should be considered a great loss.  The whole support cast, whether Polish actor or German commander, all play very well managing to bring both wit and pathos to the film.\n\nOverall a film that is not as uncomfortable to watch as I suspected it might have been, in fact one that is downright hilarious at times and has all the sharpness and wit that I want in a comedy.  When Jack Benny says `so they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt&apos; for the 5th time, I defy you not to be rolling!",

Most of the attention was on a competing animated film but this is the one that turned out to be a huge box-office success. Word of mouth helped his immensely. It&apos;s what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it. I wound up agreeing with them: it&apos;s excellent entertainment.\n\nThe visuals and sound are very impressive, but it&apos;s the story that carries this film: a solid combination of humor, drama, suspense, family ties and action. The action, as in many modern-day films, was overdone in the last half hour of the movie but overall....the DVD is a good investment since people 3 to 63 should enjoy this.\n\nAs an adult, it&apos;s not always easy to keep my attention for two hours with animation but the fact this movie does, tells you how good the story is presented. There are wonderful colors in here, too, and a good 5.1 surround system with a sub-woofer would probably blow the roof off!",

I don&apos;t know how Pontecorvo and Co. managed it, but they did. I first saw the movie in a packed LA theatre in 1967. The place absolutely rocked when the FLN vowed to continue their struggle— shades of the anti-Vietnam war then shaping up. I guess the colonial French learned their lesson in Vietnam and Algeria, a lesson neo-colonial Americans are still learning. Anyway, there&apos;s not much I can add to the hundreds of reviews already in place. That is, except to say that what stayed and still stays with me are the peasant faces, etched by years of hardship. Plus, the native quarters with their claustrophobic passageways that resemble a prison more than a neighborhood. No way Hollywood can duplicate these. Thanks Mr. Pontecorvo and all the others for a world-class lesson in movie making and difficult truths.",

One of the things that sets this movie apart from the other movies that involve animals is how they stuck to reality instead of throwing in some a-little-hard-to-believe elements here and there just to make it more entertaining.\n\nSometimes they show things through Hachi&apos;s eyes as opposed to human eyes, which helps you relate to him and understand how he felt and what he thought then, as well as emphasizes that Hachi is the main character of the movie.\n\nThis is not just a kids&apos; movie. In the end everyone including myself was crying because we were so moved. It is a must-see.",

Hulbert character wanted to do whats right , but then he was forced into a situation .... I tend to feel very sad ,because I witnessed so much similar cases. But then sadness turn into anger. Why ...Why was he forced into situation like this??!?!someone has to take responsibility!! I don&apos;t want to give too much spoilers . Whats really more upsetting . The fact that this movie is entirely based on socio-economic difficulties . Ya...What about others who suffer this and more...!!!!!! What&apos;s your take on this?????Or do they have to make a movie to get their message conveyed????",

As a person who has been experienced those years, the film became a very big sentimental burden for me. Those were the tough days for many. It is a very touchy story..\n\nHowever, it is not that what makes this film good one.. You don&apos;t need to know all Turkish history to feel the movie.. You don&apos;t need to be Turkish either.. This is emotion.. This is life.. The Mediterrenean way of life.. I guess in a Mediterrenean perspective the movie would appeal to many. I myself watched a lot of Italian movies with similar scenario. The life from a 7-8 yo kid&apos;s eyes gather things in a three-generational dimension.... There are many scenes that are going to be remembered long.. The first encountering of the kid and grandfather is really touchy.. The blood is thicker than water.. This is what so called about a FAMILY..\n\nBy the way for the international audience.. Deniz is name of Turkey&apos;s one of the most famous leftish youth leaders in 70:s with a great charismatic personality. So, that&apos;s why the name of the kid is not at all a coincidence..",

            "reviewBody": "This is a fantastic movie full action, adventure, humor and a hell of a lot more! The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but that time flies by as you are transported into an awesome world of swashbuckling and sword fights.\n\nJohnny Depp&apos;s performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener&apos;s daughter, Elizabeth Swan. She is also another young, up and coming star with a bright future ahead of her.\n\nThe film may not be the most historically accurate pirate film of all times but all that is forgotten as you enjoy the brilliance of this marvelous movie. Did I also catch a subtle omage to the 1953 swashbuckler &apos;The Crimson Pirate&apos; when Will and Jack walk underwater in an upturned rowing boat? Sneaky!\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say, and believe me I don&apos;t want to say it, is that fact we are never told the reason why the curse of the black pearl could only be broken by the blood of William Turner (Senior) and in turn by his son. Despite this plot flaw however, Pirates of the Caribbean is a magical journey that will drop the jaws of parents, children and grandparents alike. I&apos;m definitely buying it when it come out on DVD!",

            "reviewBody": "They say that you should wait 20 or 30 years before attempting to capture an historical event on film.  That is why it was remarkable that Oliver Stone was able to capture the &quot;feel&quot; of Viet Nam (in &quot;Platoon&quot;) so soon (13 years) after America&apos;s withdrawal.  Usually, an honest perspective takes more time to develop.\n\nBut, when you consider that John Steinbeck and John Ford needed less than ten years to bring the 1932 &quot;dust bowl&quot; to life, you really have to admire their magnificent achievement.    \n\nOf course, in 1940, Ford could not film much of the graphic squalor described in the novel.  For example, the film cannot show a starving hobo suckling at the breast of a young Rose of Sharon, who has milk to spare following the death of her baby.  But, far from degradation, Rose of Sharon&apos;s gesture is a reflection of the goodness that resides within her, and that quality is well illustrated in the character development seen on the screen.  Tom Joad may be an ex-con, but he is a good man.\n\n One of the commentaries (below) uses this film to rant about the exploitation in today&apos;s society.  That completely misses the point.  Ford, who was as conservative as anyone in Hollywood, even more conservative than John Wayne, used this movie to show that Man can triumph, despite the natural and human barriers that are put in his way.   \n\n This is ultimately a movie about hope and the human spirit.",

Hitchcock&apos;s style and eye for detail combine very well with a story (from a novel that is extremely good in its own right) filled with psychological fear and settings that are interesting and suggestive.\n\nMost of the time the story itself moves fairly slowly, allowing the focus to be on the characters, but there are also a couple of very good plot twists, which can be very surprising if you&apos;ve not seen the movie or read the novel. So if you happen not to know the story, it&apos;s a good idea to see the film before reading a lot of comments about it.  Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, Judith Anderson, and George Sanders are all perfectly cast and do a wonderful job bringing their characters to life, and making you feel a part of the story.\n\n&quot;Rebecca&quot; should be satisfying not only to any Hitchcock fan, but to anyone who likes classic movies.  Whether you like romance, suspense, or drama, they&apos;re all here, and put together by a director and cast that are masters of their art.",

Personally I was really impressed by the quality, perfection, and superb acting of this Mexican movie. The movie consists of three different stories connected by one sole incident. Sometimes you will see the same scene from a different point of view. Or you&apos;ll see an out of place scene that will make sense later on. The script was exquisite, very loyal to the culture. The direction was brilliant keeping us interested from beginning to end. And the performances were excellent, so natural and real that you felt as if they were people you knew. Be aware there&apos;s extreme violence in this movie, and even though there were kids in the theater I went to, this is not a family movie. I don&apos;t recommend it for children if you are a responsible parent. This movie deserves an award.",

            "reviewBody": "Having had the advantage of reading Donn Pearce&apos;s novel about a year before seeing Cool Hand Luke, it was with great anticipation that I awaited it&apos;s transfer to the big screen.  I was not disappointed.\n\nCool Hand Luke could easily be classified by the misguided as just a prison yarn, but it is so much more than that.  It is the story of a man who refuses to be nailed down or conform to the rules and regulations of a society that he has never craved to fit into.  When Lucas Jackson is arrested for cutting heads off parking meters, his explanation to the prison captain(Strother Martin) is &quot;Small Town, not much to do in the evening&quot;, which would have us believe he was just being drunk and stupid.  Later, to one of the other inmates he mutters the same answer, but importantly adds &quot;just settlin some old scores&quot;.  It is a brief but important point in helping to define the character of Luke beyond just being drunk and damaging public property.  As a service man, we also discover that Luke won a bronze star, achieved the rank of sergeant but came out as a private.  Again, early evidence that Luke is unable to conform to any body&apos;s rules but his own. Yet, we are given clear evidence that Luke knows what is right in principal and what is wrong.  At one point in the film when they are putting Luke in the box under less than reasonable circumstances, he tells the boss, &quot;calling it your job don&apos;t make it right, Boss.&quot;  In a visit from his mother Arletta(Jo Van Fleet), Luke says plenty about his own character by telling her, &quot;A man&apos;s got to go his own way&quot; or as he also puts it, &quot;I tried to live always free and above board like you but I can&apos;t seem to find no elbow room&quot;. \n\nAs Luke enters the prison that will supposedly be his home for the next two years, we meet the other inmates.  Some of them wear chains, some of them do not.  It is a point early in the film that director Stuart Rosenberg, emphasizes.  We understand quickly that sooner or later you conform.    You either walk the line the way the bosses tell you to, or they will find the means to get you to walk the line.  As the Captain reiterates, &quot;for your own good, you&apos;ll learn the rules&quot; A point driven home often.\n\nWhat we discover about their crimes is minuscule.  One is jailed for manslaughter after hitting a pedestrian with his car, another is a paper hanger, another new inmate is charged with breaking, entering and assault. The nature of their crimes is unimportant to us.  It enables to view these prisoners as men, and while we don&apos;t feel any genuine sympathy for them, feeling disgusted by their crimes would have been a distraction from the true purpose of Pearce&apos;s story, and Luke as the focal point.\n\n Because of his individuality, it doesn&apos;t take Luke long before he unexpectedly becomes a hero to the other inmates.  It is not a role he chooses, or even wants.  It unexpectedly imposes the burden on him of having to live up to the expectations of others.  He never truly understands the nature of this hero worship, and would be just as happy if he didn&apos;t have to deal with it.  He is still trying to find his way in the world, and if there is any real purpose for his existence.\n\nAnother principal character is Dragline(George Kennedy).  It is he who finally establishes the fact that Cool Hand Luke is a man who can not be beaten.  Dragline&apos;s admiration for Luke seems to extend from the fact that he(Dragline)has learned the rules on how to get by, but yet regrets having lost some of his own individuality in the process.  He is the rest of the inmates in microcosm.  I can&apos;t remember a role that George Kennedy has ever been better in, and he deservedly won the best supporting actor award.\n\nCool Hand Luke is not without it&apos;s humorous moments especially in the  early going.  It is these moments that help move the film from the early stages to the darker more despairing later stages.  Perhaps, for that reason alone we are even more effected by Luke&apos;s dilemma.\n\nIn translating his novel to the screen Donn Pearce along with Frank Pierson, has managed to bring the heart and soul of his nove to the big screen.  Lalo Shifrin&apos;s memorable score emphasizes often the repeated drudgery of working on the chain gang.  Director Stuart Rosenberg made more good films after Cool Hand Luke, but in my opinion never achieved the same degree of perfection that he does here.   \n\nAs Cool Hand Luke, Paul Newman give one of the most memorable performances in a long distinguished career.  It is not an easy task portraying a man who travels the road from being a sincere individualist, to a man who may be beaten and defeated, yet in the end is still unwilling to accept that fate. Although Rod Steiger won the best actor award that year, one could argue that Newman&apos;s role was more difficult, as it required substantially different subtle ranges in character.  As for the failure of Cool Hand Luke to achieve a Best Picture nomination, I&apos;m at a loss to explain that malfunction, especially when the likes of Doctor Doolittle and Guess Who&apos;s Coming To Dinner, far lesser efforts than this were nominated.\n\nCool Hand Luke is a true classic in every sense of the word.  It is a film that will long be remembered.\n\nMy grade: A+",

            "reviewBody": "Les quatre-cents coups is the film that opens up the New Wave movement. I think many of the characteristics of the New Wave -as pointed out in class- can be inferred form the differences between the last film we saw in class, Carné&apos;s Les enfants du paradis, and this work by Truffaut: real life situations, no sets, everyday people. I have found in Les quatre-cents coups a brand new, refreshing and overwhelming cinema. But Les quatre-cents coups is also a dense, complicated film. Its autobiographical character makes it an encyclopedia of personal feelings, opinions and nuances of an introspection by Truffaut.\n\nTechnically, the main differences between Truffaut and the previous cinema is the use of camera movements and angles. Although Renoir had made a witty and fresh use of traveling and long takes, Truffaut masters this technique as anyone else does. The camera moves smoothly, it nearly swings or floats from angle to angle following an action, as if the spectator was a ghost amid real life. Truffaut enjoys playing around with the camera: extremely long takes as we have never seen in any of the previous films: some of them in the classroom, other in Antoine&apos;s friend house, or a magnificent take at the end of the film in which we see Antoine, then a panoramic view and then Antoine again, running towards the sea. He also shoots from impossible angles, like those at the beginning from below the Tour Eiffel, or the nearly zenithal take following the jogging students in the streets. Or he teases us with the fake black out, when Antoine goes down the stairs to throw away garbage. Or shows us inner feelings through close-ups: the scene in which Antoine lies to his father telling him he did not take his map.\n\nHowever, I think that the most important difference between previous films and this one is the treatment of action. Truffaut is an observer, a photographer of soul. He takes a fiendish delight in shooting casual, long scenes: the boy tearing away his notebook pages; the whole sequence of Antoine&apos;s arrival at his empty home is excellent: the three reflexes in his mother&apos;s mirror -in which she will look afterwards, or Antoine combing his hair, laying the table. Also the spinning ride, or the long traveling following the escape of Antoine. They are long, but not slow. They keep tension up, as if everyday acts and decisions could be heroic and transmit the greatest interest and attraction. It looks like a documentary on human life! Some comments could be made about Antoine Doinel, alter ego of Truffaut. He is a very complicated character. The most curious thing about him is that he behaves like an adult: he acts, walks and talks like a man -especially if we compare him to his teachers or his father! However, at some times I think Truffaut describes himself as being not too witty: remember the candle in the hole on the wall, or how his friend convinces him to steal the typewriter and then makes him give it back, or how he innocently copies a whole paragraph from Balzac. He wants to be an artist, but he is not -not yet. This lack of wit and fatality -he is caught but everyone around him cheats as he does- leads him to a rebellion that grows stronger and stronger. This explain why he is such a rebel and not his friend, or the other children in the class, who live in the same social group.\n\nThe main topic in Les quatre-cents coups is the quest for freedom, but not in the way Renoir  looked at it, in fact is closer to L&apos;Atalante by Vigo than to Renoir&apos;s La grande illusion, for example. Renoir is more concerned by social struggle and the liberty of the people. But Truffaut is more introspective, more intimate: indeed this film is the description of life attitude of an independent spirit through the autobiographical look of the author -this is cinéma d&apos;auteur. We can find many elements from Truffaut&apos;s life in the film: a difficult family situation, problems at school, the Army, etc. These elements will appear throughout the film. Antoine, alter ego of Truffaut lives in the school, in his house, in the streets and finally in the juvenile detention center. In each one of these places he will find adverse situations he will have to overcome.\n\nThe school The school is the first oppressing environment for Antoine. At the very beginning he is caught, by chance, with a pin-up calendar. This fatality will be recalled in Antoine&apos;s life later or -when he is caught by the porter giving the typewriter back, having been his friend&apos;s idea to steal it. He is a rebel, and nothing will refrain him from being so. He is punished, and he misbehaves again, writing in the wall an inspired poem. The school is the only place in which Truffaut makes a little bit of criticism, in this case against the education system: the three teachers are either cruel (the French teacher) or stupid (the English and Physical Education teachers).\n\nThe house The house situation might be similar to that lived by Truffaut in real life. Her mother, a beautiful, egocentric and unscrupulous woman -sometimes sad, and old looking- who hates him. At the end of the film we discover that she did not want that child. This hatred and the attitude of his father -a smiley and cheerful but weak man- will add to the necessity of Antoine to flee. Truffaut gives us a Freudian wink: when his teacher asks him why he missed school, Antoine will sharply answer: &apos;My mom died!&apos;\n\nThe streets In the streets Antoine will find freedom, challenge, adulthood but also perversion: he becomes a man in a 13-year old boy body, little by little. But he will also become a criminal; together with his friend they will climb up in the scale of crime. He first skips classes. He and his friend stroll around the city, innocently. Then they begin an adult, abnormally rebel behavior: they make cars stop in the middle of the street, for example. The spinning ride is one of the few symbolic images in the film -that is another difference with Vigo and Renoir filmmaking. The scene of Antoine trying without success to fight against centrifuge force in a mad spinning trip really shocked me: he fights against reality and he is suffering, but he also has fun in it. Afterwards, he leaves home. . He will learn about solitude and indeed not a single word is heard in a long sequence. I really enjoyed the long, silent scene of the milk robbery. Antoine runs outlaw like an animal, we can feel loneliness, cold, hunger, sleepiness. It is another of those long, slow but at the same time agile scenes about casual acts: drinking a bottle of milk. At the end, the streets will make him a criminal. From the moment he is caught on, he is not treated as a child anymore. He wants to be an adult, and a spell will sort of be cast on him: he will be treated as such. It is significant when he is caught by the porter. He is told not to take off the hat, which made him look like an adult. From then on, he is treated roughly as if he was a man, especially in the police station.\n\nThe prison And finally he arrives at the prison, which I think is the climax of oppression -we must remember the comparisons to the Army Truffaut detests. It is maybe the simplest of the scenarios, he find himself facing what he hates with no other possibility. The ending is a sublime anticlimax. After being punished for eating the bread, Antoine goes on &apos;normal&apos; life within the detention center: he visits the psychologist -an ultimate introspection by Truffaut-, receives his mother and talk to his new friends and plays soccer. And suddenly, when we least expect it, he flees. He runs, runs, runs, the longest run I have ever seen, and the most exciting. He reaches the sea: his dream, and a symbol for eternity and absolute in poetry. He splashes into the water, he stops and looks back; the first time he looks right into the camera. This has got undoubtedly a deep and very personal meaning that maybe only the author knows. It is a pessimistic or an optimistic ending? I think it is above all an out-of-this-world ending. If the simple presence of the sea, Antoine&apos;s object of liberty, is overwhelming for the spectator, how should the character feel? I really liked the final traveling: we follow Antoine&apos;s run over the sand, but the camera is facing the inland, we are waiting to see the sea as much as Antoine is waiting to wet his feet. I do not really think that he is deceived, although his look into the camera is ambiguous. I think he stares at the spectator because he has realized what the truth is: the character is now out of the film. And the truth for him, I think, is this: I can reach freedom whenever I want, but absolute freedom is impossible to achieve. He is staring at us, but he is also looking back with a grave look: he might have seen his pursuer in the distance.",

This is probably the best way to watch it, as I did not know where the plot was going to start or go. Essentially a con man plans to seduce, marry, and abandon a wealthy unmarried woman – taking her from her uncle and then taking her money. To do this he employs the services of a young pickpocket to work as her handmaiden, and help work the plan from the inside, so to speak.\n\nWhat the film does with this basic plot is enjoyable and engaging. The narrative is solid, holds the interest without effort, and is very well paced and structured. I wonder would it work as well if I had known the source material, or had more knowledge of the wider plot. As a con, the plot is solidly enjoyable and avoids the silly flamboyance of some films where such a plot would be allowed to turn into a &apos;caper&apos;. Within the plot are some surprisingly sexual elements, and these sit across the sweet, the sensual, and the dark. There is also a good amount of humor where it matters – in particular in part 1 of the film, this is used well in relation to the main character.\n\nThe direction, production values, and general pacing of the film, all work together to give it a beautiful appearance and tone. It is quite sensuous to watch, with such great colors, sets, costumes, and designs. Within this the actors are all strong. Min-hee Kim and Tae- ri Kim in particular are engaging, although the downside of me being into their characters/performances was that it made the heavy nudity in some of their extended scenes feel a bit exploitative in nature. Jung-woo Ha is solid throughout, and Jin-woong Jo is just the right level of monster for the plot to work.\n\nA richly enjoyable film, that sits across so many elements and looks so good that it keeps the plot engaging throughout.",

As a big fan of hers, I can watch this musical over and over and just sigh.\n\nWise and his cinematographer have photographed Andrews in a manner that no other director has--even her husband. Watch the scene where Maria watches the Captain sing Edelweiss with the kids. Wise turns her into a gauzy angel. It is a fantastic moment among hundreds that this movie contains.\n\nI am firmly in a camp that says Julie Andrews was completely, utterly, and regrettably robbed when the 1965 Oscars were handed out. She embodied Maria Von Trapp, wholly and with every fiber of her being (just watch the scene in which she races the boys in a segment of &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;; she runs at the camera with utter abandon here, no holding back. Or consider the shot at the end of this song, where she places her hand atop her head--it&apos;s as if even SHE can&apos;t believe she&apos;s hitting that note).\n\nThe Julie Christie performance that beat Andrews is now all but forgotton. &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; however, lives on and on.\n\n&quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is a bit bittersweet for me, given that audiences tastes would soon turn away from big-budget musicals in general and Julie Andrews specifically. But what a legacy it (and she) have left!",

            "reviewBody": "I have seen this movie a few times over the year and have just recently  viewed it again twice on the DVD version. This is a highly recommended  movie on several levels. First, it has to be seen because it won  multiple academy awards during 1934. It has won at least best actor, best actress and best director.  So it should be seen just for it&apos;s historical significance if you are  into movies as an art form. However, if you are just looking for  entertainment then it is simply a great classic romantic comedy. The  set up is that Ellie (Claudette Colbert) is a rich, spoiled,  independent woman who is running away from her father (in Florida) to  join her husband (not quite a complete marriage) in New York City. She  meets Peter (Clark Gable) on the bus who is a down &amp; out reporter  looking for a big story. They join forces in that he will help her to  get to New York for an exclusive on her story. In essence it is the  bratty socialite vs the hard nosed -know it all reporter - Can they  achieve true love? Just watch the movie and figure it out for  yourself.. There is the classical scene regarding the battle of the  sexes which involves hitchhiking. There is some dated material because  the movie was made in the 30&apos;s about the 30&apos;s. This may be both good  and bad as a viewing experience. Gable is a bit too shallow as a  desirable character. He lacks the sensitivity of a guy that would be in  a modern romantic comedy. However, his portrayal of Peter is likely  typical for the ideal man of the era in that he attempted to be  competent and in charge at all times (the know it all guy). The  character comes across as too simplistic by today&apos;s standards. However,  when he gets the feedback on his rough edges from Ellie he shows his  nice guy side. Claudette Colbert is great in this movie she had  opportunities to display her acting craft as she responded to different  situations. The scene in which she and Gable pretended to be basically  &apos;white trash&apos; was very funny. Her getting the best actress award is  very evident even without having to see the performances of her  rivalries for the Oscar in 1934. Overall this movie is rated a 9.0 and  is highly recommended. A viewer may avoid older movies because they  lack dept; however, hang in for this one. Once the screen chemistry  starts between Colbert and Gable (their first scene together) the rest  of the picture is just a joyride of entertainment in watching these two  work their magic for the camera. Enjoy this movie it should be an  awesome experience.",

            "reviewBody": "There are few motion pictures that rely on bodily expression and imagery as most films depend too much on dialogue and speech.  Persona(1966) is one of those raw movies that succeeds almost on a metaphysical level.  Its about the relationship between an actress who broke down during a stage performance and the nurse who is assigned to take care of her.  Bergman&apos;s camera has a fascination with Ullmann&apos;s figure as most of the film&apos;s closeup shots are on her.  Liv Ullmann does an outstanding job in playing a character that hardly utters a line of dialogue.\n\n There are a few scenes where the image dominates the screen in a manner that hasn&apos;t been done successfully since the silent film period.  The director, Ingmar Bergman did an excellent job in presenting powerful images with the use of natural sound.  Persona(1966) is a triumph of acting because both Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann are terrific in their perspective roles. There is hardly any movie music and this adds to the tension between the two women.  Its a film that was deserving of a Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1966.\n\n One scene that was wonderful is when Alma describes her life to her patient. Another excellent scene is when Mr. Vogler mistakes Alma for his wife(its as if he too has suffered a breakdown and has failed to recognize his own wife).  Finally, the sequence where Alma and Mrs. Vogler&apos;s image blends together to form one person.  Its an errie image because they cease to exist as individual people.  Persona(1966) would influence Robert Altman very greatly when he directed the film, Three Women(1977).",

The variety and range of characters the Pythons play is sublime. The chemistry they have with each of other is what makes the film work so well.

It was also the first I saw - on Christmas Day afternoon 1978 on UK BBC2 - would that they were as adventurous nowadays! Since then of course I&apos;ve seen all of his films from Stray Dog on, Rashomon and Ran being especial favourites, but I keep on coming back to watch this one, ostensibly the simplest tale Kurosawa ever filmed.\n\nThe understanding and bonding that develops between the two men Arseniev and Dersu is wonderful to see, and over two hours holds your attention with expertly observed minutiae of character and scenic interplay. The last ten minutes cover a lot of ground (no pun intended) but it&apos;s all so logical and sad that I always need to see the end credits to recover.\n\nSo many marvellous scenes: the tiger in the forest in the morning; the phlegmatic reclusive old Chinaman; the raft; wispy blue shaded smoke from night-fires; the conclusion of course; the view of those two great men, the Moon and the Sun in the same shot. Not everyone would like Dersu, their most likely comments being &quot;boring&quot; - but how wrong they are they&apos;ll never know!\n\nA film not fit to lick Dersu Uzala&apos;s metaphorical boots (or even Plan 9 from Outer Space&apos;s for that matter), Blazing Saddles was filmed the same year in America and a generation on still gets more praise than this poetic masterpiece!",

Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop &apos;The Iron Giant&apos; provided.\n\nThe film&apos;s plot is similar to &apos;E.T.&apos; - a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space, who is stranded on earth, and runs afoul of paranoid government agents.  Not to knock the Spielberg film, but what makes &apos;The Iron Giant&apos; the better film is that the young boy is the teacher.  It is he who has to teach the Giant about the beauty of life, the difference between good and evil, and choices we have to make.  The Iron Giant, it turns out, is a weapon, who has to struggle against his own nature.  The film has an obvious (and timely) gun control message, but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people.  We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.\n\nI dare not give away the climax.  All I will say is that it features a sacrifice absolutely breaktaking and emotionally shattering (albeit somewhat blunted by the ending).  The animation is gorgeous, Michael Kamen&apos;s score is perfect, and the film beautifully evokes the 1950s.\n\nSadly, poor marketing kept audiences away in droves.  All I can say is, to heck with the box office gross.  Despite Warner&apos;s appearant desire to pretend the film never existed, the word is getting around about what a magical film this is, and I have no doubt it will join &apos;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&apos; as a film which bombed in theatres but became a classic over the years.  See it now, so you can say you discovered it before everyone else did.",

I will admit some of the Arab characters seemed to be stereotyped-but no more so than in Mulan or Tarzan or whatever; animation seems to stereotype Everything.\n\nA great movie, ***1/2 outta ****, a fave then and now.",

            "reviewBody": "While &quot;The Help&quot; has received TONS of great press and a ton of SAG and other awards, I am also aware that there is some controversy concerning the film. Some people have felt that the film was a bit paternalistic--as it might be interpreted as yet another story of a rich, enlightened white lady going out to help all the downtrodden black folk. I am just not sure if I could see this or not--especially as the black women in the film end up showing LOTS of strength during the course of the film. BUT, I am also a white guy--and it&apos;s not fair for me to automatically brand the film one way or another. Just be aware that there are a few who resent the idea of this film.\n\nI could discuss the plot, but LOTS of other reviewers have discussed this. So instead, let&apos;s talk about what I liked and didn&apos;t like. I liked the acting. The problem, however, is that giving any of these actresses awards is tough as it&apos;s such an ensemble cast. I can truly understand why the Screen Actor&apos;s Guild chose to award ALL the cast a joint award. The direction was very nice and the movie was well filmed. The script was also very nice--and quite inspiring. My quibbles are VERY small---very, very small. I felt that a few characters were a bit one-dimensional (particularly the lead villainess). Also, the ending of the film seemed to drag out a bit and wrapping it up a bit sooner. It wasn&apos;t a bad ending--but tightening would have heightened the overall emotional impact.\n\nSo my advice for you is to see this film. While I still think &quot;Hugo&quot; is the best nominated film this year, I can see the merit in &quot;The Help&quot; winning and &quot;The Artist&quot; sure seems to have a lot of momentum. So, do yourself a favor and see all three--all three are terrific.",

Ben Kingsley&apos;s interpretation of the Mahatma must go down in history as one of the most perfect cinema rôles ever carried out. Throughout the long film you forget you are watching an actor playing the part of a great man in history: you are watching the real Gandhi. A gigantic performance indeed. Richard Attenborough&apos;s patient and perfect directing added all the superlatives possible to make a crowning achievement, transporting  biographic films into another dimension.\n\nIt is all there: from the most intimate and poignant portrait to the incredible crowd scenes, beautifully captured in the most painstaking photography. You do not just watch the scenes unfold  you live them, you feel them, so captivating they are; and Ravi Shankar&apos;s music tugs at you, spellbinds you, forces you into sympathy, admiration and so many other feelings. \n\nEnthralling: how such a cinematographic work of art can reach such proportions is truly amazing; this film is nothing less than a miracle. During 1971 I travelled a good bit around India; I constantly had to apologise to energetic Indians who approached me on the subject of the British Raj. I had not even been born. But as a young and unappointed ambassador, I felt it my duty to bow my head in that country which is a microcosm of the whole planet. Thanks to this film, `Gandhi&apos;, Attenborough and Kingsley have said just about all there was to say.\n\n&lt; For men may come and men may go, but Gandhi goes on forever &gt;",

            "reviewBody": "Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you&apos;re walking on an acid trip experience. It&apos;s an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.\n\nAnd this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick &amp; Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!\n\nProduced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it&apos;s such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What&apos;s even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.\n\nThis film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It&apos;s fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there&apos;s just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.\n\nEEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.\n\nMichelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she&apos;s fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she&apos;s doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It&apos;s not easy to play her role and it&apos;s definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.\n\nThere were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you&apos;re forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it&apos;s just funny you&apos;re having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it&apos;s aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you&apos;re watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you&apos;re watching. You&apos;ll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!\n\nIf there&apos;s one dislike from this film is that it&apos;s gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.\n\nVerdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We&apos;re only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!",
